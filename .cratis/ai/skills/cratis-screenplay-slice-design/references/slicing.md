# Slicing, state transitions and the next slice

## Slices are the authoring unit

In Screenplay every construct already lives in a typed slice, so slicing is not a separate
step at the end: design each behaviour as its slice, then audit the set.

| Slice | Holds | Named after | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `StateChange` | command, its events, its constraints, specs | the command (`AssignLocker`) | one command per slice; renderable: required |
| `StateView` | read model, queries, projection/reducer, screen, specs | the view (`LockerBoard`) | one read model per slice |
| `Automation` | reactions, the events they produce | the behaviour (`RemindUncollectedParcels`) | see `cratis-screenplay-automations-and-translations` |
| `Translate` | captures, translated events | the integration (`CarrierManifests`) | see `cratis-screenplay-automations-and-translations` |

Screenplay allows several commands or read models in one slice; prefer splitting unless the
behaviour is genuinely one (and say why in the `description`).

## Slice dependencies

Record, per slice, the events it consumes and which slice produces each. This is for
orientation, not a build order: view specifications use synthetic `given` events, so slices
are built and checked independently. A command or reaction may consult another slice's view
(`reads`; unprotected in `.play`, see `rule-layers.md`). A slice never calls another slice's
command except through `invokes`. Dependencies run in one direction; a cycle through events
means the story is a feedback loop that belongs in an `Automation` slice.

The contract between slices is events: slice B depends on slice A because B's command, rule
or view needs an event A produces. Two other edges are supported and recorded explicitly, never
implied: `reads <View>` from another slice (unprotected, so a stored-state rule over it stays
NOT enforced, `rule-layers.md`) and `invokes <Command>` from a reaction. No shared state or
other direct call. Name each
slice after its element (the command, the view, the automation, the translation (capture or translator reaction)), not a broader feature name
that spans several. Per slice, record:

```text
Slice:       <CommandName | ViewName | AutomationName>   (StateChange | StateView | Automation | Translate)
Produces:    <events, and when they occur>
Consumes:    <events from other slices, and why this slice needs them>
Upstream:    <slice X: needed because it produces <Event>>
Downstream:  <slice Y: consumes <Event> this slice produces>
Reads:       <views of other slices, with the rule they feed; NOT enforced>
Invokes:     <commands of other slices called by a reaction, and the trusted actor>
```

For `worked-example.md`:

| Slice | Consumes | Produced by | Also reads |
|---|---|---|---|
| InstallLocker | none | | |
| RequestLocker | none | | |
| AssignLocker | none (appends `LockerAssigned`) | | views LockerSummary, RequestStatus (intent, not enforced) |
| LockerBoard | LockerInstalled, LockerAssigned | InstallLocker, AssignLocker | |
| RequestProgress | LockerRequested, LockerAssigned | RequestLocker, AssignLocker | |

## State-transition table (per entity)

Rows are states (named after the fact that put the entity there); columns are commands. Each
cell: the resulting event, or the refusal and where it is enforced. Fill every cell; blank
cells hide missing decisions.

For the locker in `worked-example.md`:

| State \ command | InstallLocker | AssignLocker |
|---|---|---|
| (none) | LockerInstalled; refused by UniqueLockerNumber if another locker holds the number | refused: `reads` + `require` (the locker is not free / the request is not waiting) - intent, NOT enforced today |
| installed | refused: LockerInstalledOnce | LockerAssigned; refused by OneLockerPerRequest if the request already has a locker |
| assigned | refused: LockerInstalledOnce | refused: OneRequestPerLocker |

The trap this table caught: `UniqueLockerNumber` alone does not stop the same locker being
installed twice, because an event source may re-claim its own value. The `unique event`
constraint closes that hole. Releasing a locker (a later slice) would add `released by` lines
to both assignment constraints.

Mark how each refusal is enforced: `authorize`, `validate`/`require` (inputs only),
`constraint` (append-time), or **target-enforced** (stored-state; recorded in the slice
`description` and the handoff as NOT enforced today, see `rule-layers.md`). Terminal states have
refusals in every column. Add one line per gated command: the caller fixture that must be
denied (it needs its `then denied` spec).

## Generic edits

A command or event named for a form (`UpdateLocker`, `LockerDetailsUpdated`) records that data
changed, not why. Rules, reactions and history lose their meaning, and the edit path usually
skips rules the install path enforces. Detect it in the state table: a command with the same
result in every row and no refusal anywhere, whose event restates most of the entity.

1. List the values the form can change; for each, ask who changes it and why.
2. Group values that change together for one reason; each group is a command and an event named
   for that reason (`RelocateLocker` -> `LockerRelocated`; `CorrectLockerVolume` ->
   `LockerVolumeCorrected`). Values nobody changes after installation need no command.
3. Give each new command its own state-table column, and fill its cell for every state, with refusals (an assigned locker cannot be
   relocated).
4. Apply rule coverage (below) to each new path.
5. If the business treats a multi-value data-entry correction as one act, keep one correction
   command named for the correction (never `Update`), with the reason in the slice
   `description`; rule coverage still applies.

A repeated-field event is a review signal; it is major only when business meaning is lost, a
rule is bypassed or consumers become ambiguous. Historical generations repeat prior shape on
purpose and are exempt.

## Rule coverage

For each value that carries a rule, list every path that can set it:

| Value | Rule and layer | Paths that set it | Covered? |
|---|---|---|---|
| locker number | unique (constraint `UniqueLockerNumber`) | InstallLocker -> LockerInstalled; RenumberLocker -> LockerRenumbered | add `unique number on LockerRenumbered` to the same constraint |
| volume | at least one litre (concept `validate`) | InstallLocker; CorrectLockerVolume | covered: the concept travels |
| attendant gate | `authorize` on the feature | every command in the feature | covered: inherited |

A constraint covers another event by repeating its `unique` line under the same constraint name
(the claim is shared) - only when the events set the **same claim**. Command-level
`validate` / `require` and `produces when` branches do not travel: review each path and copy a
rule only where that decision needs it; move a format rule into the concept so it travels.

## Slice audit

- Every event belongs to exactly one `StateChange` (or `Automation`/`Translate`) slice.
- Every command has a reachable, authorized origin.
- Every read model has a consumer and a keyed query when the scope is executable.
- Every slice has a `description` that states its business purpose.
- No slice exists only for technical reasons ("set up storage").

## The next slice

If the request names the capability, build that one. Otherwise, when the current timeline is
fully designed, read the slices in story order and choose, preferring in order:

1. the next stage of an existing lifecycle (a locker can be assigned; can it be released?);
2. an action a screen implies but nothing implements (a button with nothing behind it), or a
   state change with no confirmation view (in the example, the attendant needs a waiting-request view to pick a request);
3. a missing ending, correction or reversal - a correction or reversal names what it corrects
   or reverses (`CorrectLockerVolume`), never `Update<Entity>`;
4. a notification or follow-up the business expects.

Apply this heuristic only when the brief authorizes selecting another capability; when the
requested scope is complete or no supported candidate remains, close the turn without inventing
work (scope ownership: `cratis-screenplay-modeling-lifecycle`). Prefer what continues the
current story over a new thread. When selecting is authorized, not knowing the next capability
is never a reason to stop: a plausible next slice (the next lifecycle stage, an unaddressed
affordance, a missing confirmation or ending) usually exists, and a wrong guess is one slice
that is easy to rename or delete. Posting a question and ending the turn with no slice
written is not an acceptable outcome; flag the assumption and write the slice in the same
turn. Report the capability chosen and why, and the slice type and elements created. A
slice with a command and a view is two slices (`StateChange` and `StateView`): write them one
at a time. In a modeling session, act: write
the slice, note the assumption that chose it, and ask for correction afterwards. A wrong guess
costs one edit; an empty turn costs a round-trip. Record why the slice was chosen in the
handoff.
