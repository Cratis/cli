# Worked example: parcel lockers (design mode)

One complete model for `cratis-screenplay-slice-design`. It is in **design mode**: V1 clean
(compiles with warnings as errors); V3 is blocked on purpose by the `ListLockers` list query
(`PLAY0268` at binding); `given clock` also fails binding on the cratis-bundled compiler only
(`cratis-screenplay-toolchain` `references/versions.md`). Personas and screens are informational.
The stored-state rules in `AssignLocker` (`reads` + `require`) are intent, not enforced today,
and they also fail binding on their own: `PLAY0271` on each `reads`, and `PLAY0268` because the
`require` operands (`locker.assigned`, `request.state`) must be command properties. So this
document is design mode as a whole: V3 is blocked twice over and no specification runs here.
The specifications still seed every read-model source (`LockerInstalled`, `LockerRequested`,
complete givens) so they are the right form once binding is possible.
Lineage matrix: `field-lineage.md`. State-transition table and rule coverage: `slicing.md`.
Per-command refusal inventory: `command-inventory.md`.

The per-event reason lines in each StateView `description` are the lineage record
(`field-lineage.md`). Multi-line descriptions use a tagged ` ```text ` fence in a real model;
they are written as one string here so this document stays a single compiling fence.
