# From technical signal to candidate meaning

Every rule here is a **modeling default** or a **review question**, not a law. A signal
proposes a reading; the evidence row records the reading as `proposed` until an expert or a
code read confirms it.

## Core question per write
For every table change, ask: *what happened in the business that made this row change, and
who decided it?* If nobody can answer, classify the row `unknown` and ask.

## Rules

| Signal | Default reading | Typical trap | Do this |
|---|---|---|---|
| One request writes several tables | one decision; one table carries the fact, the others are consequences | one event per table (`CheckinCreated`, `HookUpdated`) | one event named for the decision (`CoatTakenIn`); consequences become projections |
| Generic update route (`PUT /members/{id}`) | several intents hidden behind one form | one `MemberUpdated` event | split by which columns change together and why (address change, suspension, renewal); ask experts. No `Update/Edit/Save<Noun>` command and no `<Noun>Updated/Changed` event; a full-payload `*Updated` event is the default generator output and a review signal |
| Request with no table write and a 4xx status | a rejected attempt; evidence of a rule | Prologue models it like a success (status codes are ignored) and the merge can strip properties | `validate`/`require`/constraint plus a `then error` spec with the exact message from code (authorization refusals are `then denied`); legacy HTTP code and check order go in the slice description |
| 2xx with no table write | read, idempotent no-op, or external side effect | treated as a command | check code; classify |
| Single-column unique index | a business uniqueness rule, or a technical key | every unique index becomes a constraint, or a clear business rule is dropped to a bare `rule` | when the meaning is clear, `unique <prop> on <every event that sets it>` plus `released by <removal event>`; list collation, case and reuse questions. Fall back to a bare `rule` only when no constraint form fits, and record that as a loss. A purely technical key stays out |
| Foreign key | an identity relation between streams or read models | copying the parent id into every event | keep ids only where a consumer needs the value |
| Audit columns (`UpdatedAt`, `RowVersion`, `ModifiedBy`) | infrastructure | event or command properties | drop; `$context` carries time and caller |
| Status/enum column changes | a lifecycle; each transition is a candidate event | one `StatusChanged` event | one event per meaningful transition |
| Write with no user command | job, trigger, stored procedure, integration, manual fix | assumed to be an automation | classify: maintenance / correction / integration / scheduled business process (trigger evidenced) / unexplained |
| Inbound integration write (feed, webhook, file import) | an outside fact entering the system | modeled as our own decision | Translate candidate with correlation and dedup (cratis-screenplay-automations-and-translations) |
| Outbound call after a write (mail, payment, partner API) | a side effect of a decision | an event per call | reaction candidate; note what "once" must mean |
| Health, simulation, test or admin routes | infrastructure or tooling | become domain modules | exclude, list in the loss report |
| Custom span or handler named for an operation (`TakeInCoat`) | the best available intent signal | ignored in favour of route names | prefer it for command names |
| Concrete ids or codes in paths (`/coats/T-551/handback`) | identifiers leaked into names | `T551` module or slice | normalise to route templates; allowlist `http.route` |
| Computed value stored (price, score, total) | a calculation | dropped as "derived" | keep as a fact when it matters historically (a quoted price); otherwise a projection |
| Soft delete flag | cancellation, archiving, or GDPR erasure | `XDeleted` | name the business reason; erasure is a PII question |

## Generator facts (static evidence)
- Exact or Configured evidence (bound symbols, attributes, registrations) is strong for
  *structure*: command and event types, properties, validators, authorization, constraints.
  It says nothing about why.
- Conventional and Heuristic evidence never establishes persistence, stream ownership or
  authorization on its own.
- An existing event-sourced system may already have business events; still check names for
  CRUD shapes and payloads for property sourcing.

## Prologue facts (dynamic evidence)
- Command names come from span names, else from `{Action}{Resource}` or
  `Create/Update/Delete/Handle{Resource}`; events are `{Table}{Created|Updated|Deleted}`.
  Treat both as placeholders.
- Command properties are the union of written columns and span attribute keys, not the
  request payload (bodies are never captured). Expect audit, foreign-key and telemetry noise.
- DB transactions correlate to a request by time window only. Under concurrency or with
  background jobs, a capture can mix several commands; check suspicious captures in code.
- PostgreSQL updates list every column of the table, not the changed ones; SQL Server lists
  changed columns.
- LLM refinement renames and describes only; it never merges, splits or removes. Renames are
  global (one key renames every occurrence) and constraint properties are not renamed, so a
  refined `.play` can be invalid.

## Read models
Source read models from screens, exports and real query usage (code, UI walk), not from table
mirrors (`All{Table}s`). Prologue never sees reads.
