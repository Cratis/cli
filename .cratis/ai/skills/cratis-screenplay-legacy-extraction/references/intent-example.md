# Intentional candidate example

A complete, compiling example of what extraction produces: one legacy write that touched two
tables (`Checkins`, `Hooks`) is re-sliced into a single decision event plus a projection. The
numbers in the slice descriptions (`E1`, `E6`, `Q3`) are evidence ids and open questions from
the evidence table (`evidence-table-template.md`) and `LOSS.md`.

What to notice:

- One StateChange per decision; the `Hooks` update is a consequence, so it is a projection
  (`CoatStatus`), not a second event.
- The unique index on the ticket number became a `unique ... on CoatTakenIn` constraint with
  `released by CoatHandedBack`. Releasing it on hand-back is an assumption pending expert
  approval (Q3), and the description says so.
- The state-dependent rule (a coat can only be handed back while on a hook) is written as
  `reads CoatStatus` + `require`, marked **NOT enforced in the model today** in the slice
  description, with its target named. No error specification is written for it.
- Every role gate found in code has `authorize` through the module policy and a `then denied`
  specification.
- The nightly hook reset (E4) is unexplained, so it is not modeled; it stays an open question
  (Q5) in the loss report.

// Evidence ids refer to rows like those in evidence-table-template.md: the legacy
// POST /api/checkins inserted Checkins and updated Hooks (E1); here that becomes one
