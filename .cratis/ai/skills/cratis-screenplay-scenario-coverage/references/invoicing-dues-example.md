# Invoicing and dues: worked example for the scenario-examples excerpts

Complete executable model (harbor club dues) holding every declaration the excerpts in
`scenario-examples.md` and `view-and-story-specs.md` rely on, except the stored-state rules. Each
of those excerpts is copied verbatim from the fence below (names are the specification names),
except `ReversingAReceivedPayment` and `RequestingARefundAfterAReversal`, which come from
`invoicing-dues-design.md` (`RefundRequester` stays with `ReversePayment` there to keep that example's source declaration and
destination-type information; a reaction can also consume events from a capture or another reaction).

**Scope.** This document is the runnable demonstration only. It deliberately holds no rule that
depends on stored state (the invoice must exist, only an open invoice may be voided, a reversal
needs a received payment, `reads` + `require`): those rules cannot bind or run at Screenplay
4.64.0 (PLAY0271, PLAY0268) and are stated in the design-mode document `invoicing-dues-design.md`,
never in prose here. It shows the category shapes; for a coverage example see `berth-reservations.md`.

```screenplay
// Needs the standalone screenplay compiler (ESM v6)
// Scenario coverage worked example: invoicing club dues (complete document).
// Backs the excerpts in scenario-examples.md and view-and-story-specs.md: issue an invoice,
// request payment, an external gateway result captured and translated, an open-invoices todo list family and an accumulating credit balance.
// Scope: executable demonstration only. No stored-state rule is declared or pretended here; those
// (invoice exists, void only if open, reversal needs a received payment) live in the design-mode
// document invoicing-dues-design.md.
// The external payment outcome is a fact (PaymentGatewayResultReceived); a refund request is a
// fact of intent, never proof that money moved.

## Notes
- The command that reverses a payment, the refund reaction and their specifications
  (`ReversingAReceivedPayment`, `RequestingARefundAfterAReversal`) are in
  `invoicing-dues-design.md`, because the command needs a stored-state rule.
- The query answers "absent" with no `result` block; the whole-list query and the `OpenInvoices`
  list view in the excerpts are design-mode expectations (list queries compile but do not bind at
  4.64.0, PLAY0268, `cratis-screenplay-toolchain`, so they are retained as design-mode expectations): see `view-and-story-specs.md`.
