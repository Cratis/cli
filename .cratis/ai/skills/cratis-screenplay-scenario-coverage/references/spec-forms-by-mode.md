# Specification forms by mode

The subsets themselves (what binds, what renders) are owned by `cratis-screenplay-toolchain`
(its executable and renderable subset references); version facts by its `references/versions.md`. This file
says what that means for writing specs. A form outside the chosen mode is never deleted from a
design model: keep it and record the gap.

| Form | design | executable | renderable |
|---|---|---|---|
| `when <Cmd>` -> `then <Event>` / `then error` / `then denied` | yes | yes | yes |
| `given <Event>` with `for` | yes | yes (needed for keyed views) | yes |
| `given readmodel` | yes | yes (complete instance with key) | only as the query-only lookup below |
| `when append <Event>` | yes | yes | no |
| `then readmodel` / `then query` (keyed `ById`, `arguments`, `result`) | yes | yes | yes |
| `then query` on list, filtered or observable queries | yes | no (query does not bind) | no |
| `then no readmodel <RM> for "<key>"` | yes | yes | no |
| `when query` -> `then result` / `then no result` | yes | yes | same as `then query`: only the query-only cases below |
| `given clock` / `when clock`, `when trigger`, `given`/`when capture` | yes | current compiler yes; cratis-bundled compiler no (see versions.md) | no |
| Command spec listing reaction cascade events | yes (v6 semantics) | false PLAY0285 on the cratis-bundled compiler; see SKILL.md "Version skew" | no (no reactions) |
| `then events in any order` | yes | yes | yes |
| Composite (JSON) values in specs | yes | yes | no |
| Rules over dates or `today`, nested paths | spec them in design | rule does not bind: `recorded` | `recorded` |
| Bodied rules, code policies | spec them | spec reported **unsupported**, never passed | no |
| Command handlers, `file` constraints, query `performer`s | spec them in design | blocked: PLAY0268 at binding, no spec runs (V3 blocked) | no |

## Design mode
Write the full intended behaviour, including scenarios the executable subset cannot run
(list views; clock, trigger and capture scenarios when only the cratis-bundled compiler is
available). Mark each such spec in the coverage matrix as
`gap: <reason>` for the narrower modes so the verification and render phases know what will not execute.

## Executable mode
- Every gated spec has `given caller`; every production and every given/expected event has `for`.
- Each read model has one key shared by its keyed `=> RM optional` queries; the identifier equals
  the projection's effective key (`cratis-screenplay-slice-design` `references/read-model-design.md`
  decision table). View specs assert through a keyed query.
- Run V3 (binding-ready, per `cratis-screenplay-toolchain`); binding-only codes (PLAY0273/0350/0352/0388/0389) appear only there.
- V4 (reference specs run) needs a runner route; otherwise report "V4 not run: no route". Unsupported is not passed.

## Renderable mode
- Specs use given events, a command `when`, and then events / readmodel / query / error /
  denied. No `when append` or `then no readmodel`. `given readmodel` appears only in the
  query-only lookup below.
- Query-only specs (no command `when`) are admitted by Stage v4.24.0 in exactly two cases, and
  `when query` and `then query` are the same case: Screenplay normalises `when query` to the
  `then query` model, so the spelling never decides admission.
  - Denial: `given caller` (no role claims), no given events or read models, one query under a
    policy, one scalar key, no `result`, `then denied`.
  - Seeded lookup: no caller, no given events, exactly one `given readmodel` (a complete
    instance, every property, with its identifier equal to the key) and one unprotected query
    over that read model with the same key and exactly one `result`.
  Any other when-less query (for example over given events, or a list) is not admitted:
  prove the view with a command `when` instead and record the rest as a gap.
- One command per `StateChange` and unconditional `produces`: alternative-path specs over
  `produces when` belong to scope that is not renderable (the example's `RecordDeparture` is
  executable, not renderable).
- Prove projections with `given` events + `when <Command>` + `then query` (or `then readmodel`).
  Removal has no admitted form: record it as a gap for renderable scope.
- A `then error` must name a constraint or rule that is actually rendered. Stage v4.24.0 admits
  a value constraint only when each target is a single, required, text-typed property (not
  composite, optional, collection or nontext), and rejects a command that produces more than one
  event affected by the same value constraint (claims or releases) in one batch. The number of
  constraints a command carries is not a limit. The example's `OneBoatPerBerthNight` is
  composite (berth and night, one a date), so it does not render: keep the constraint and its
  protection, and record the gap. Check the renderable subset in `cratis-screenplay-toolchain`
  before promising V5.
- One spec maps to one or more generated test classes, snake-cased from the spec name: the
  command class `when_<spec_name>`, plus `when_<spec_name>_is_projected` per `then readmodel`
  and `when_<spec_name>_is_queried` per `then query`; with several read models or queries the
  suffix gains `_into_<read_model>` or `_through_<query>`. A query-only spec renders only its
  `_is_queried` class. V5 reports evidence for every class of each spec, not just the command class.
