# Invoicing and dues: design-mode document for the stored-state rules

**Design mode, not binding-ready by design.** This document states the stored-state rules of the
invoicing example as the skill requires (`reads <View>` + `require ... message`, marked NOT
enforced in the slice `description`, target named). It compiles (V1, warnings as errors) but
does not bind at Screenplay 4.64.0, and the only blockers are `reads` (PLAY0271) and `require` over
a view (PLAY0268), so no specification here runs (V3 blocked). `PaymentReceived` has its producer
here (the capture and `ReceivedTranslator`), so nothing else blocks: with every `reads` and
`require` line removed the document binds. The rules cover an unknown invoice, voiding a paid
invoice, reversing without a received payment and a second reversal (`ReceivedPayments` drops the
row on `PaymentReversed`). It is not a full coverage example: for that see `berth-reservations.md`.
Keep those lines: they state real intent and are never
replaced by prose. The runnable counterpart, which holds no stored-state rule, is
`invoicing-dues-example.md`; `scenario-examples.md` copies `ReversingAReceivedPayment` from here.

```screenplay
// Needs the standalone screenplay compiler (ESM v6)
// Scenario coverage design-mode example: stored-state rules of invoicing club dues (complete document).
// Design mode: `reads` is PLAY0271 and `require` over a view is PLAY0268 at binding (the only
// blockers), so this model compiles but is not executable; the specifications below do not run. The runnable counterpart
// is invoicing-dues-example.md.
// Target enforcement of every rule here: Arc [ProtectedDecision] with DecisionRead<T> (Arc v22.39.0
// or later, not in a Stage-rendered application), or a Chronicle DCB; Screenplay#129/#209.
