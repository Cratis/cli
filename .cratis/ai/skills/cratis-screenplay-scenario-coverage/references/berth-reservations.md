# Berth reservations: worked example

Complete, compiled design-mode model (marina guest berths) showing a coverage matrix turned into specifications: happy path, one rejection per rule, authorization denial, duplicate and retry, competing claim, state violation, alternative branches, compensation and a view lifecycle family. The matrix for it is in `coverage-matrix.md`; the catalogue (`scenario-catalogue.md`) names its specifications.

```screenplay
// Scenario coverage worked example: guest berths at a marina (complete document).
// Shows a coverage matrix turned into specifications: happy path, one rejection per rule,
// authorization denial, duplicate/retry, concurrent claim, state violation, alternative branches,
// compensation (cancellation frees the berth-night) and a view lifecycle family.
// Screens and personas are out of scope here (cratis-screenplay-slice-design). This is the canonical design-mode
// example: stored-state rules (the reservation must be live) are stated as `reads BerthBooking`
// + `require ... message` and marked NOT enforced in the slice descriptions, with their target
// named. Binding reports PLAY0271/PLAY0268 for them (expected; Screenplay#129/#209): such a model
// is design-complete but not binding-ready, and that is reported, never "fixed" by deleting the
// rules. The past-date rule (`night >= today`) is declarative too: ESM v1 has no runtime date,
// so binding reports PLAY0268 on it (recorded as blocked, not moved into prose); the rule and its rejection
// specification stay so the intent executes once a date value exists.
// Verified: V1 (warnings as errors). V3 binding is blocked by the stored-state and date rules.

      description "One guest boat per berth per night. OneBoatPerBerthNight declares that two event sources cannot hold the same berth-night; the competing-claim specification pins the loser's rejection after an earlier holder. It neither runs two commands at once nor proves the runtime's index-and-append behaviour under failure: that needs target-level verification. A retried ReserveBerth with the same reservation id is refused by ReserveOnce: the fact occurs once, but the retry is NOT answered with success, so a client that lost the first acknowledgement must treat this rejection as 'already reserved' (idempotent handling is a target decision, recorded as an open question). The night must not be in the past: declared in `validate` (`night >= today`) with its rejection specification. Binding reports PLAY0268 for date comparisons today (ESM v1 has no runtime date value), so this rule is design-complete but blocks V3 until Screenplay supports it."
