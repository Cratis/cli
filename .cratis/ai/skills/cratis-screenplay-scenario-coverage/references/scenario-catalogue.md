# Scenario catalogue

For each type: the question to put to the domain, when it applies, when "n/a" is a legitimate
answer, the Screenplay shape, and traps. Excerpts point to the complete compiled example
`berth-reservations.md` (marina guest berths). An `n/a` must name a domain reason; a
`recorded` cell names what the language cannot express and where the rule is written down.

## Eliciting cases
Skip what the brief or model already answers. Otherwise ask:
- Which mistakes would be costly to get wrong?
- For this rule: one allowed request, the nearest refused one, and why they differ.
- What changes once the action has succeeded? What if the acknowledgement was lost?
- What if another identity already holds the same value?
- Which input flips the outcome, and what happens exactly at the boundary?
- Who may do or see this, and which otherwise-valid caller must be refused?
- What reverses the decision, and what must disappear, remain or become available afterwards?

Write each useful counterexample down at once as a candidate obligation. Business owners answer
intent, developers enforcement and failure boundaries, testers the distinguishing fixtures; record
who actually answered - an agent asking itself four kinds of question is not four approvals.
Unknown answers become questions, never invented rules. A quick pass may defer cases but must
name them as unfinished.

## 1. Happy path
- Ask: "When everything is in order, what is now true that was not before?"
- Applies: always, once per distinct success outcome.
- Shape: `when <Cmd>` with every input stated; `then` lists every production that fires, in
  order, with full payloads and `for`. See `ReservingAGuestBerth`.
- Traps: asserting a subset of events (lists are exact); leaving out `given caller` on a gated
  command; omitting `for` so the event lands on an allocated source.

## 2. Rule rejection (one per rule)
- Ask: "Which values would you refuse, and what would you tell the person?"
- Applies: every command `validate`/`require` rule that is a business rule, and every
  `concept` rule.
- Concept rules travel with every use: cover each once with representative acceptance,
  rejection and boundary specs through one command that carries the concept, not on every
  use. Never an automatic `n/a`.
- Shape: `then error "<the rule's message, verbatim>"` (prefer a `$strings.<key>` message where
  the model uses strings). The language accepts a bare `then error` (it matches any rejection),
  but this pack requires the pinned message: a bare error cannot show which rule fired. See
  `RejectingAZeroLength`, `RejectingAnOversizedBoat`.
- Vary only the value the rule checks; keep every other value as in the success case.
- Concept rule: one rejection spec per concept through one command (`RejectingAnEmptyBerthCode`).
  This matches `cratis-screenplay-specifications`, which also asks for one rejection spec per
  concept rule; the spec proves the rule travels with the concept.
- Traps: one spec covering two rules; `then error ""`; expecting `severity warning` to pass.

## 3. Authorization denial
- Ask: "Who can see this screen but must not do this?"
- Applies: every command or query with an effective gate, including module and feature gates:
  one `then denied` per command or query, not one per feature. Persona "Cannot" lines count only
  once they resolve to a gate plus this spec; otherwise record a gap.
- Shape: `given caller` that is authenticated but lacks the role or claim -> `then denied`
  (commands: no other outcome; read-only queries: `then query <Query>` with `arguments`, no
  `result`, then `then denied`; or `when query` + `then denied`). See `RefusingASkipper`.
  An empty `given caller` block is the anonymous caller.
- Specs cannot name a persona: write the caller as the roles and claims that persona's
  policies grant and name the spec after the persona. One denial per persona that can reach the
  screen but may not act. Derive fixtures from the effective Boolean gate: AND - isolate each
  missing conjunct; OR - a caller meeting any permitted alternative must succeed (a success
  spec, not `then denied`); denial only when the whole gate is false.
- Ownership policies (`claim ... matches subject|<property>`): the denial gives the right role
  and a claim with another value (`claim "ownerId" = "<other id>"`); the success spec gives the
  matching value. Both are needed. Ownership checks on Uuid-backed identifiers do not render
  today (STAGE-ESM-015): note it.
- Traps: `then error` for a denial; a denial spec whose inputs also break a rule (it still
  denies, but reads ambiguously); trusting a `cratis run` sandbox answer (it enforces neither
  authorization nor validation); counting another command's denial.

## 4. State violation
- Ask: "After which earlier facts must this request be refused?"
- Applies: lifecycle rules (cannot cancel after departure, cannot pay twice).
- Expressible today: exclusivity of facts per event source (`unique event` lines sharing one
  constraint name), uniqueness of values across sources. See `CancelOrDepart` and
  `RejectingACancellationAfterDeparture` (command validation) and
  `AppendingACancellationAfterDeparture` (the constraint).
- Not enforced in the model today: rules over stored state such as "the reservation must exist"
  or "amount within the remaining balance". Write the rule as `reads <View>` + `require <expr>
  message "..."` (PLAY0268/0271 at binding are expected; report the model as
  design-complete but not binding-ready, never delete the rule to bind), mark it NOT enforced in the slice `description`, name its target (Arc
  `[ProtectedDecision]` + `DecisionRead<T>`, Chronicle DCB, or a constraint), mark the cell
  `recorded` and list it in the phase report. Forbidden: a caller-supplied copy of state in `require`,
  a boolean attestation input (`confirmsX == true`) standing in for the rule, and rules hidden in
  `handler` or implementation-hint prose. An unguarded materialized read is unsafe for a
  protected decision.

## 5. Duplicate action and retry
- Ask: "What if the same request arrives twice - a double click, a timeout and retry, a
  replayed message?"
- Decide which promise the business needs:
  - **once-only fact**: the second attempt must not create a second fact (`unique event`);
  - **idempotent handling**: the second attempt must *succeed* without a new fact - not
    expressible as a constraint outcome; record it as a target requirement;
  - **exactly-once external effect**: an email, payment or shipment - never proven by the model.
- Shape (once-only): `when <Command>` with the earlier fact as `given` (same `for`) -> the
  constraint's fixed message. Use `when append <Event>` for projection or automation
  triggers, and to isolate a constraint the command's own validation would reject first
  (`AppendingARepeatedDeparture`); not otherwise for duplicates. See `RejectingARetriedReservation` (constraint message through `when <Command>`),
  `RejectingARepeatedDeparture` (validation first) and `AppendingARepeatedDeparture` (isolated constraint).
- n/a only when repeating is harmless and wanted (a note added twice is two notes).
- Trap: claiming retry safety from a todo-list read model plus reaction; it shows intent, not
  delivery guarantees.

## 6. Competing claim (concurrency)
- Ask: "What if two people try at the same moment? Who wins, and what does the other see?"
- Applies: any scarce or unique thing (a berth-night, a username, a seat).
- Shape: a spec cannot run two commands in parallel. Pin the loser's outcome instead: `when
  <Command>` with the *other* event source's fact as `given` (different `for`, same constrained
  value) -> `then error "Constraint '<Name>' is violated: another event source already holds
  the constrained value."` See `RejectingASecondBoatForTheSameBerthNight`. This does not prove
  the runtime's behaviour under real concurrency (`chronicle-verification.md`).
- If no constraint can hold the rule (it spans stored state), the race is unprotected: mark
  `recorded`, name the target enforcement (DCB or `[ProtectedDecision]`;
  `cratis-screenplay-streams-and-consistency`).

## 7. Alternative path
- Ask: "Which inputs change the result, and what happens either side of the boundary?"
- Applies: every `produces when` and every domain-described alternative outcome.
- Shape: for each condition a feasible true and a false witness (threshold equality where it
  distinguishes the rule). Conditions are independent: include meaningful overlaps and assert
  the full event set, every unconditional production plus each conditional one that fires. When
  all conditions are false the unconditional productions still occur. See
  `RecordingACleanDeparture` (only `BoatDeparted`) and `RecordingADepartureWithDamage` (both).
- Zero new facts: a command whose productions are all conditional may be accepted with no
  facts. There is no `then no events` syntax. A command spec with no `then` events but with a
  view or query assertion is still executable as a zero-fact check: the runner compares the
  command's facts with the (empty) expected list by exact count, so any fact produced fails it
  (Screenplay v4.64.0). Write it that way, name it for the zero-fact outcome, and keep the view
  assertion for the visible state. Record the obligation as unasserted only where the runner is
  not available.

## 8. Ordering and timing
- Ask: "Can these facts arrive late, early or out of order? What happens at the boundary of a
  deadline?"
- Within one event source order is the append order. Across sources (another context, a
  capture, a reaction) the view or translation must cope with any order.
- Shape: view family whose givens are in a different order; translation specs where the
  external record arrives before our own fact; `given clock`/`when clock` for deadlines
  (binds on the current compiler, not the cratis-bundled one: `cratis-screenplay-toolchain` `references/versions.md`; see
  `cratis-screenplay-automations-and-translations`).
- n/a: a single event source, with no external or cross-source input.

## 9. External failure
- Ask: "What if the other party refuses, never answers, or answers twice?"
- Applies: captures, translations, reactions whose realization calls out.
- Shape: the reported outcome is a **fact** (a refusal received is an event), specified in the
  Translate or Automation slice; a missing answer is a time-based scenario. A rejection
  (`then error`) is only for requests we refuse ourselves.
- n/a: no external system in the path.

## 10. Compensation
- Ask: "Can this be undone or corrected? What must undoing release or restore?"
- Shape: the reversal command's own specs, plus a spec proving the effect of the reversal:
  a released claim (`ReservingABerthNightFreedByACancellation`) or a removed row
  (`BerthBoardLifecycle3Cancelled`). Corrections are new facts, never edits of old ones.
- Often reveals a missing event: if nothing can undo a fact the business can reverse, ask.

## 11. Evolution compatibility
- Ask (when an event's contract changes): "Do facts already stored still mean the same?"
- Compatible change (added property with a defined default): declare the new generation;
  specify behaviour on the new generation; write the default for old facts in `description`
  (Screenplay does not express upcasters). Change of meaning: a new event, with its own specs.
- Renaming a stored event keeps an `id "<OldName>"` pin. A rename the brief requests is done in
  this pass by the identity owner (`cratis-screenplay-modeling-lifecycle`); never leave it silently unapplied.
- Event evolution and generations: `cratis-screenplay-streams-and-consistency`.
- n/a: new contracts never stored anywhere yet.

## 12. Views
See `view-and-story-specs.md`.

## Example data
Read the local context first: the target declaration, its concepts, rules, gates and the
producer/projection/query mappings, and the specs already there. Follow the value path (command
input -> event payload -> projected field -> query result); matching field names alone do not
mean values should agree. Do not load the whole model to fill one fixture.

Preserve existing intentional examples. Add missing cases instead of rewriting a happy-path
fixture; correct a value only to fix a demonstrated contradiction, and say so. Never change
rules, gates, mappings or contracts to make an example pass.

- One small synthetic cast per feature with deterministic ids, so one reservation reads as a
  story across reserve, depart and cancel; each spec still states its full world.
- Values follow declared types and concept rules: UUID literals for UUID concepts, typed numbers
  and booleans, quoted declared enum members. Dates are concrete ISO dates in the story's
  future, instants offset-qualified; fix `given clock` when asserting occurrence-time values.
  No `{uuid}`/`{now}` placeholders. No real personal data.
- Structured values: single-line JSON with quoted keys and required members; empty, single and
  several items where that changes behaviour.
- Competing claim: different source ids, same constrained value. Retry: same source id and inputs.
  Removal: an existing target, plus a second row that must survive. Branch: inputs that flip the
  condition. Denial: valid business input, vary only the caller. Validation: satisfy every other
  rule.
- Unknown domain values stay questions, not plausible inventions.
- Handoff after fixture work reports: the spec names added or changed; each meaningful fixture
  change and why (a demonstrated contradiction, never a rule changed to fit); which existing
  intentional examples were preserved; where a reused value came from (the event, command input
  or mapping it is traced to) and where values could not be traced; and unresolved
  inconsistencies between specs. Check the resulting source, not just that a write succeeded; a
  clean compile does not show the expected outcomes are right.
