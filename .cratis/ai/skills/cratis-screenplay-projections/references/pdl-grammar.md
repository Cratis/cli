# PDL — syntax grammar, meaning and diagnostics

Checked against `Documentation/screenplay/projections/{grammar,semantic-model,keys,variants}.md`
and `Source/DotNET/Screenplay/Parsing/ProjectionParser.cs` at Screenplay tag
`v4.31.0` (commit `355dffb`).

The grammar says what **parses**. It does not say what an event does at runtime:
Chronicle's lowering decides that (Screenplay decision 0001), and the
[meaning table](#syntax-that-parses-but-means-something-else) lists the places
where the two differ. The braces on a composite key are optional, and
`EveryBlock` accepts a bare `automap` as well as `no automap`.

## Diagnostics

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `PLAY0054` | A projection document's top-level line does not open a `projection` |
| `PLAY0055` | A projection document declares no projection |
| `PLAY0056` | A `projection` line is not `projection <Name> [=> <ReadModel>]` |

| `PLAY0295`–`PLAY0299` | An `$eventContext` path the event-context catalog does not have |
| `PLAY0380` | Chronicle drops part of a construct: `all` below the top level, or `automap` on a joined event |
| `PLAY0381` | A projection-level `key` routes no event |
| `PLAY0382`–`PLAY0385` | Variant errors: no `enters on`, shared mapping missing on a variant, duplicate variant name, entering event claimed twice |
| `PLAY0397` | Inline code uses a language line instead of a tagged fence |
| `PLAY0398` / `PLAY0399` | A reducer mixes bodied and body-less rules / observes one event twice |

## Syntax that parses but means something else

| Syntax | What Chronicle and the executable model do |
| --- | --- |
| `key` on the projection | Nothing: events route by the `from` key, then the event source id (`PLAY0381`) |
| `from X` with no key | Routes by the event source id, never by another `from`'s key |
| `join … on …` | Updates existing instances only; never creates one; the name after `join` is discarded |
| `automap` under a joined event | Replaced by the auto-map of the join's level (`PLAY0380`) |
| `all` inside `children`/`nested` | Behaves as `every` (`PLAY0380`) |
| `$causedBy.<x>` | Does not bind; use `$eventContext.causedBy.<x>` |
| Templates in mappings or keys | Do not bind |
| A number or Boolean literal key | Read as a property path; write `key literal "…"` |
| `parent` outside `children` | Ignored by Chronicle; does not bind |
| `sequence` | Realization concern; does not bind |
| Reducer rules | Opaque ESM v3 code keyed by the event source id; not computed by the reference runner |
| `$eventContext.<path>` other than `eventSourceId` in a mapping or key | Binds; the reference execution plan refuses it, so no specification in the model runs there |
| `remove via join` on a projection's own level | Chronicle's engine wires it as a child removal; binds, but the reference execution plan refuses it |
| `all` beside removals, `children` or `nested` | Binds, but the reference execution plan refuses it |
| `join`, `children` or `remove via join` inside `nested` | Not wired by Chronicle's engine; binds, but the reference execution plan refuses it |

## Worked examples

Each example is an excerpt: the events and read models it names are declared
elsewhere in the slice or model. Read-model properties in a `.play` model are
camelCase (a PascalCase property line is `PLAY0016`), so mapping targets are too.
Several examples map `$eventContext.occurred`, `sequenceNumber` or
`causedBy.subject`. Those bind, but the reference runner cannot execute a model
that contains them; a target must run their specifications.

### Composite key with event context

```screenplay
projection LineItems => LineItemReadModel
  from LineItemAdded
    key LineItemKey
      orderId        = orderId
      lineNumber     = lineNumber
      sequenceNumber = $eventContext.sequenceNumber
      createdBy      = $eventContext.causedBy.subject
    product = productName
```

### Global counter with a literal key

```screenplay
projection SiteStats => SiteStatsReadModel
  from UserLoggedIn key literal "site-stats"
    count totalLogins
    lastLogin = $eventContext.occurred
```

Every `UserLoggedIn` updates the same instance, whatever its event source.

### System-wide audit with `all` alongside `from`

```screenplay
projection ActivityFeed => ActivityFeedModel
  all
    count totalSystemEvents
    lastActivity = $eventContext.occurred
  from UserRegistered
    recentUsers = name
```

`all` subscribes to **every** event type in the system; `recentUsers` only fills
on `UserRegistered`. Chronicle keys the event types that only `all`
reaches by their **event source id**, so each event source gets its own instance
and its own count; `all` takes no key of its own.

### Children with a join and scoped removal

```screenplay
projection Group => GroupReadModel
  from GroupCreated
    name = name
  children members identified by userId
    from UserAddedToGroup key userId
      parent groupId
      role = role
    join userName on userId
      with UserCreated
        userName = name
    remove with UserRemovedFromGroup key userId
      parent groupId
```

### `every` that ignores child activity

```screenplay
projection Group => GroupReadModel
  every
    lastActivity = $eventContext.occurred
    exclude children
  from GroupCreated
    name = name
  children members identified by userId
    from UserAdded key userId
      parent groupId
      name = userName
```

Group-level events bump `lastActivity`; member events do not.

### Nested nullable object

```screenplay
projection Slice => SliceReadModel
  from SliceCreated
    name = name
  nested command
    from CommandSetForSlice
      name   = commandName
      schema = schema
    from CommandRenamed
      name = newName
    clear with CommandClearedForSlice
```

`command` is null until `CommandSetForSlice`, updated in place by
`CommandRenamed`, and set back to null by `CommandClearedForSlice`.

### Several projections in one slice

```screenplay
slice StateView CustomerPortalReport
  readmodel PortalReportReadModel
    invitedAt DateTime
  readmodel RevokedPortalTokenReadModel
    revokedAt DateTime
  query GetPortalReport => PortalReportReadModel
    by customerId CustomerId
  projection PortalReport => PortalReportReadModel
    from PortalInvitationSent
      invitedAt = $eventContext.occurred
  projection RevokedPortalToken => RevokedPortalTokenReadModel
    from PortalTokenRevoked
      revokedAt = $eventContext.occurred
```

Two read models, one behavior. Splitting them across two slices would say the
system has two behaviors where it has one.
