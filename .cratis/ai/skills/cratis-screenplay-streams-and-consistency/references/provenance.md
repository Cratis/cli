| Source file | Used in | How |
|---|---|---|
| `.claude/skills/eventmodeling-optimizing-stream-design/SKILL.md`: golden rule, identity-then-every-event review, classification table | `SKILL.md` Procedure 1, `references/stream-patterns.md` "Identity and event-membership review", "Interpret the evidence" | adapted closely; "long history is fine" kept, translated to `identifier`/`for` |
| `.claude/skills/eventmodeling-optimizing-stream-design`, patterns reference: decision tree, red flags 2-4, composite and collection and log patterns | `references/stream-patterns.md` "Boundary decision tree", "Red flags", "Boundary patterns by domain" | adapted closely, restored from #493; red flag 1 ("no natural end") dropped because it contradicts long-lived identities; event-granularity tip dropped (generic update events are a defect here) |
| `.claude/skills/eventmodeling-optimizing-stream-design`, domain-patterns reference: per-domain identity entries | `references/stream-patterns.md` "Boundary patterns by domain" | translated to invoicing, marina, memberships, enrolment and hire; lifetimes and archival splits dropped |
| `.claude/skills/eventmodeling-applying-conways-law/SKILL.md`: interview questions with follow-up triggers, six-step ownership workflow, quality checklist | `references/boundaries.md` "Ownership interview", "Ownership and interface inventory", "Responsibility matrix and ownership timeline", "Boundary checklist" | adapted closely; "team = system" absolutes deliberately not adopted, kept "not by law" |
| `.claude/skills/eventmodeling-applying-conways-law`, examples reference: responsibility matrix, swimlane timeline, inter-system communication | `references/boundaries.md` "Responsibility matrix and ownership timeline", "Worked walkthrough" | translated to marina and invoicing; Martin Dilger and Nebulit GmbH's indirect-producer attribution not copied |
| `.claude/skills/eventmodeling-core-rules/SKILL.md`: immutability, calculated-event anti-pattern, causality, open question versus decided failure, "left chair" fan-out, offline-first | `references/stream-patterns.md` "Core rules that bear on stream design", `SKILL.md` modeling defaults | adapted closely, translated to Screenplay constructs; board lanes, linked copies and role catalog not adopted here (other skills own them) |
