# Event evolution

Stored facts outlive the code and the model that wrote them. Plan a change by asking what
happens to facts already stored, to every reader of the event, and to the deployment window
when old and new code run side by side. The best evolution is the one you avoid: short
lifecycles and events that record what the business decided (not table rows) change less.

## Classify the change
Edit class depends on whether the event is **persisted** (facts may be stored: the model was
accepted, deployed or rendered into a running system; ask when unsure). Changing an
unpersisted event's members is an ordinary text edit when no `.screenplay/identities.json` exists; with it, adding or removing event properties changes catalog addresses and goes through MCP. Any change to a
persisted event's contract (new generation, property added, removed or retyped, meaning) is
**contract evolution**: identity-affecting (identity procedure in `cratis-screenplay-modeling-lifecycle`). Write the
compatibility scenarios below first; the identity owner then applies the change (see
*Identity owner*). The table assumes a persisted event.

| Change | Old facts still mean the same? | Screenplay action | Edit class |
|---|---|---|---|
| add a property with a business-defined value for old facts | yes | new `generation N+1`, every generation declared in full in the same slice; record the default for old facts in the slice `description` | contract evolution |
| add a property with no sensible old value | the old fact lacks information | usually a **new event** for the new situation, or a separate fact recording the extra information | review with the expert |
| remove a property | yes, if no reader needs it | new generation without it; every reference fails with PLAY0273 until removed | contract evolution, check readers |
| change meaning (same name, different business fact) | **no** | **new event** with its own name; old event stays for history | identity: add, not rename |
| rename (same meaning) | yes | identity-aware rename by the identity owner; the stored name is kept with `id "OldName"` | identity-affecting |
| split one event into two / merge two | depends | new events from now on; never rewrite history; projections read both old and new | identity-affecting |
| rename a constraint | n/a | starts an empty index: values claimed before are unprotected. Ask first | identity-affecting |

A test for "generation or new event": a new version must be convertible from the old one
without inventing facts. If it is not, it is a different event.

## Compatibility scenarios (write before editing)
For each changed event, answer in the slice `description` or `STATE.md`:
1. **Replay**: does every projection still build from generation 1 facts? Which value do old
   facts give the new property (default, absent, derived)?
2. **Readers**: which projections, reactions, constraints, specifications and other modules
   (imports) reference this event? Each needs a decision.
3. **Mixed deployment**: can old code read new facts during rollout? If not, order the rollout
   (readers first) or use a new event.
4. **Constraints**: does a constrained property change type, casing or meaning? A changed
   meaning under the same constraint name corrupts uniqueness.
5. **Migration**: Screenplay does not express migrations or upcasters. Chronicle's route is
   event-type migrations between consecutive generations (defaults, renames, split/combine of
   properties, value maps); a migration maps one event to one event and never splits a fact into
   several. A target without migration support must reject an evolved contract. Record who
   writes the migration and test replay of old-generation facts; disposable greenfield data
   needs none.
6. **Specifications**: `given` facts use the current shape only (a historical shape is
   PLAY0449). Old-shape behaviour is checked in the target, not in `.play` specs.

## Identity rules
- Generations of one event live in one slice; a same-named event in another slice is a
  different contract, not a generation (and ambiguous to the binder).
- Leave `id` absent on new events; a pin equal to the event's current name is information
  PLAY0471 (Screenplay `events.md`). MCP and workspace renames add the pin by default because
  the tool cannot know whether events were stored; set "never persisted" only when you know.
- Every rename, move or removal of an event, constraint, command, read model, slice, feature
  or module is identity-affecting and is done by the identity owner.

## Identity owner
Procedure and ownership: the identity procedure in `cratis-screenplay-modeling-lifecycle` (the
owning session, or a brief that asks for the rename, applies it; a subagent without MCP returns
the catalog-changing request to the owner; never leave a requested change silently unapplied).
- Several generations select ESM v4; that binds executably on both tools (compiled
  with `evolution-example.md`).

Complete compiled example: `evolution-example.md` (generation, rename pin, meaning change).
