# Example: streams, constraints and a recorded rule

A complete design-mode model for course enrolment. It shows one business identity per stream,
cross-stream references as payload, three kinds of uniqueness constraint, a state-dependent
rule recorded as **NOT enforced in the model today**, a declared `concurrency` scope, and an
active-state view with removal. Read it with `consistency-and-concurrency.md` (sections 1-4).

The model compiles (V1, warnings as errors) but is not binding-ready by design: the `@pii`
concept fails binding (PLAY0268), `reads` and the `concurrency` block are PLAY0271, and
`require` over a view is PLAY0268. Keep those lines: they state real intent.

```screenplay
// cratis-screenplay-streams-and-consistency: complete design-mode example (V1 with --warnings-as-errors).
// Shows: one business identity per stream, cross-stream references as payload, uniqueness
// constraints (single, composite with release, unique event), a recorded state-dependent rule
// that Screenplay cannot enforce, a declared concurrency scope, and an active-state view with removal.
// Not executable on either tool (probed): the @pii concept fails binding (PLAY0268), the
// concurrency block and `reads` are PLAY0271, `require` over a view is PLAY0268. Keep them: they state
// real intent. The capacity rule is NOT enforced in the model today (see the slice description).
