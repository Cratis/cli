# Provenance

## Method lineage
- Event Modeling: Adam Dymitruk (eventmodeling.org); Martin Dilger, *Understanding Eventsourcing*.
- The two-phase process, nine steps, four patterns and GWT discipline follow
  [jwilger/agent-skills `event-modeling`](https://github.com/jwilger/agent-skills/tree/main/skills/event-modeling),
  as noted in `SKILL.md`; Cratis divergences are stated there.
- Screenplay vocabulary and the model-first rule come from the Cratis Screenplay documentation.
