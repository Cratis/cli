# Complete invoicing example (parent of the Step 5 and Step 6 excerpts)

One compiling document, in design mode (the `ListInvoices` list query blocks V3; the document
declares no specification, so nothing is lost for running), holding the `RegisterInvoice` slice
(Step 5) and the `InvoiceList` slice (Step 6) with the concepts, policy and events they rely on. The excerpts in
[nine-steps.md](nine-steps.md) are these slices, verbatim.

```screenplay

concept InvoiceId : Uuid
concept InvoiceNumber : String
concept InvoiceStatus : String

policy CanManageInvoice
  require role "Accountant"
