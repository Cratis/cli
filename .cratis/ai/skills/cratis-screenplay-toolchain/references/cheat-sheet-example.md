# Cheat-sheet example (design mode)

One complete document with every construct family. Design mode, not executable. Prose rules: [cheat-sheet.md](cheat-sheet.md); tool versions: [versions.md](versions.md); what binds: [executable-subset.md](executable-subset.md).

Blocking on every compiler: unquoted import, `@pii`, `reads` (PLAY0271), `starts with`, observable/list/filter query. Also blocking on the cratis-bundled compiler only: trigger, `given clock`, Automation and Translate slices, reactions, capture. Executable shapes are in the sibling examples. The first line of the fence marks it standalone-only, so the cratis pass skips it: `RecordingAPayment` lists the `InvoiceClosed` cascade, which the cratis-bundled 4.60.1 compiler rejects with a false PLAY0285 ("outcome cannot be produced by 'RecordPayment'").
