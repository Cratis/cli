# Automation and Translate example (ESM v6)

Executable Automation and Translate slices. Needs the standalone compiler: the cratis-bundled compiler rejects it (PLAY0268 at binding, false PLAY0285 at compile on the cascade spec in `SubscribingAMember`); see [versions.md](versions.md). Shows a reaction `produces` cascade, `invokes`, `where`, clock `at`, an application trigger, a capture with translate and a transition `when`, and v6 specifications.

The `Renew` command is ungated so that the reaction can invoke it: this is a syntax demonstration, not a safe production design. Reactions invoke with no caller, so a real model needs a trusted path (see [cratis-screenplay-automations-and-translations](../../cratis-screenplay-automations-and-translations/SKILL.md)).
