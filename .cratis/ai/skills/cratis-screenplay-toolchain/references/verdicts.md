# Verdict commands, V1 to V5

The five verdicts are independent results, not a ladder: each proves only its own layer,
and each is either a result or "not run" with the reason. The verdict names are frozen
(`cratis-screenplay-modeling-lifecycle` owns when each is required; this file owns how to
obtain it). Tool and version facts: `versions.md`. No script ships with this skill: V2 and
V3 are read from the MCP server or from a render, V1 and V5 from the CLIs.

| Verdict | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| V1 | authorable: compiles, warnings as errors |
| V2 | executable diagnostics: the binder's diagnostics were read |
| V3 | binding-ready: the executable model binds with no blocking executable diagnostics |
| V4 | reference specifications run |
| V5 | rendered and target-verified: admission, publication, build and tests, each separately |

## V1: authorable

| Tool | Command | Pass | Fail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standalone (preferred) | `screenplay <model-folder> --warnaserror --no-color` | exit 0 and `N file(s) compiled - 0 error(s), 0 warning(s)` | exit 1 |
| cratis (fallback) | `cratis screenplay validate <model-folder> --warnings-as-errors -o json-compact` | exit 0 | exit 5; exit 1 means missing path or no files |

- Always validate the **folder**. cratis file mode ignores imports (cli#244); the standalone
  tool follows them, but a folder run is the same on both tools.
- An empty folder exits 0 on the standalone tool: read the file count.
- Warnings are failures here. PLAY0029 (a construct dropped silently) and the unresolved-name
  warnings are the defects this verdict exists to catch.
- Syntax and consistency checks (PLAY0282 to PLAY0294) run; binding does not.
- Report: `V1 pass (screenplay 4.64.0, 3 files)`, `V1 fail: PLAY0029 a.play:12 ...`.

## V2: executable diagnostics

Needs an MCP connection (V2 and V3 belong to the session that owns MCP; a subagent without
MCP reports `V2 not run: no MCP in this agent` unless the brief supplies fresh output).

1. Start the server with a fixed root: `screenplay mcp <model-folder>` or `cratis screenplay
   mcp` in a project with `.cratis/ai.json` (see `versions.md`, roots bug). Send
   `initialize`, then `notifications/initialized`.
2. `open-workspace`. The result carries `readiness` (`authoringAccepted`, `executableReady`)
   and `executableDiagnosticsCount`.
3. Read the diagnostics: `read-workspace` with `view: "executable-diagnostics"` and the
   current `expectedRevision` (page with `offset`; paging beyond the first page needs the
   source revision).
4. Report the codes with counts, blocking (error severity) apart from informational. A list
   with blocking entries is a valid V2 result (`V2 read: 6 blocking, PLAY0268 x3 list query,
   @pii ...`); it is the evidence for a "V3 blocked" report. The view also lists
   information-severity diagnostics (PLAY0269 deferred UI, PLAY0270 authoring metadata such as
   descriptions, personas and screens) on models that bind; they do not block.

`authoringAccepted: true` only says the source compiled (or the root is empty). It says
nothing about print or parse fidelity or identity continuity.

## V3: binding-ready

V3 holds when `executableReady` is true and V2 returned **no blocking** (error-severity)
executable diagnostics; informational PLAY0269/PLAY0270 entries are reported separately and
do not block. The ESM then binds (and `read-workspace view=executable-model` reports `available: true` with a
`modelRevision`; avoid reading the whole model bytes just for the revision unless a
comparison needs it). Binding is what makes a model renderable at all. V3 means "binds",
never "specifications pass".

- Report the ESM version the model needs: `V3 ready (screenplay 4.64.0, ESM v6)`,
  `V3 blocked: PLAY0268 x3 (list query, @pii) - design scope kept`.
- A blocked V3 is not repaired by deleting protection or domain rules. Never remove `@pii`,
  `@sensitive`, authorization, list queries, automations or rules to reach V3; record the
  slice and the code in the gap list.
- A model is "executable" only on the compiler that bound it. A V3 from the standalone tool
  does not carry to `cratis render` (bundled 4.60.1, ESM v1 to v5; Stage v1 to v3).

## V4: reference specifications run

No MCP tool and no compile command runs specifications (Screenplay#377 is open). V4 comes
only from an actually executed Screenplay **reference** route. Record the route, the expected
versus discovered specification count, and passed, failed, unsupported and cancelled counts.
The reference runner returns unsupported for a specification that reads a reducer-built read
model and for any construct whose evaluation needs an opaque body.

**Rendered Debug tests are never V4.** A rendered application is a different engine: Stage
4.24 admits pure reducer bodies and generates reducer replay and assertions in its Debug
tests, so the two engines can differ (a pure reducer body is a concrete case). Report those
outcomes only under V5.tests, labelled target-test evidence. The `cratis/stage-specrunner` job
(Docker, opt-in; behaviour on ESM v4 to v6 unverified) runs Stage's own semantic executor
(`SemanticSpecificationExecutor`, Stage `v4.24.0` `Source/SpecRunner/Program.cs`), not the
reference route: report its outcomes on a separate line, "Stage semantic engine (target-engine
evidence)", never as V4 and not as V5.tests.
Without a reference route: `V4 not run: no route`.

## V5: rendered and target-verified

`cratis render` is the entry point; it neither builds nor tests. Report four separate
results, plus runtime when it was exercised:

1. **Admission**: the render plan was accepted, or the STAGE-ESM / PLAY / CLI-RENDER codes
   that rejected it (nothing is rendered on rejection).
2. **Publication**: what was written, unchanged or refused (`.cratis-render.json`,
   `.cratis-render/journal.json`; `recovered: true` means stop and reconcile).
3. **Build**: Debug build of the destination (`dotnet build`).
4. **Tests**: Debug tests of the destination (`dotnet test`). Generated specifications are
   compiled in Debug only; map results by generated spec class (`when_<snake>` in namespace
   `<Slice ns>.when_<snake>`, `when_<snake>_is_queried`, `when_<snake>_is_projected`) back to
   the `.play` specification, not by test counts.

Never claim a whole-application V5 from a rendered subset. Render workflow, ownership
and gap-fill: `cratis-screenplay-render-and-gap-fill` and `cratis-stage-rendering-and-sandbox`.
What Stage admits: `renderable-subset.md`.

## Report format

One line per verdict, tool and version first, evidence second:

```text
V1 pass (screenplay 4.64.0, 3 files)
V2 read (screenplay 4.64.0 via MCP): 0 blocking, 3 informational (PLAY0270)
V3 ready (screenplay 4.64.0, ESM v3)
V4 not run: no route
V5 admission pass (cratis 3.27.1, Stage 4.24.0); publication written 14 files; build not run; tests not run
```

Rules: a clean verdict never implies a later one; a verdict names the **source identity** it
ran on (commit plus the digest from the source-identity helper (`cratis-screenplay-modeling-lifecycle` `references/verdicts-and-modes.md` "Source identity")); a tool or
source change makes earlier verdicts stale.

## Example gate (for skill and documentation authors)

Every complete `screenplay` fence in this corpus compiles with the standalone tool at the
pin and `--warnaserror`. Every fence without the marker `// Needs the standalone screenplay
compiler (ESM v6)` also passes `cratis screenplay validate --warnings-as-errors` (3.27.1) on
a folder holding that one file. Examples meant to execute are also opened through MCP and
must be `executableReady`. No example uses `numbers exact`.

Edit strategy for `.play` changes (typed identity-preserving operations preferred, bounded text
edits for address-preserving changes) is in
`SKILL.md`; the MCP edit procedure is in `cratis-screenplay-model-authoring`.
