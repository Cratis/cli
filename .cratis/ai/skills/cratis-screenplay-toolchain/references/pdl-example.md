# Projection (PDL) example

Projection forms that compile warning-free, bind on both tools and run in the reference runner without Unsupported results (`PlacingAnOrder`, `CancellingAnOrder`, `Depositing` and `RejectingAnEmptyCode` pass). The specifications exercise every, from, `set`, increment, remove with, all + count, add/subtract by, `clear` and the concept rules; `PlacingAnOrder` also runs the `children lines` block (through `LineAdded`) without asserting it; join, nested and variant groups bind but no specification drives them. Forms in this example: every, join, children, nested, clear with, remove with, increment/decrement, all + count, add/subtract by, set to, clear, no automap, literal mapping, variant group (no `=> RM`), concept rules not empty/max/length ==. `lineCount` is initialized in `OrderPlaced` and `shipping` is optional, because the reference runner requires every non-optional read-model property to be set after each fact. Rejected by the binder: more than one every/all block on one level (PLAY0268); `$eventContext.occurred.Week` (PLAY0273, derived value). Not in this example because they block the whole execution plan in the reference runner (Screenplay v4.64.0): a `remove via join` on a projection's own (root) level (`UnsupportedProjectionBlock`; it binds, but on Chronicle v19.32.0 it creates no removal subscription, so `CustomerDeleted` would not remove an `OrderView`), and any event-context value other than the event source identity in a projection, such as `$eventContext.occurred` (`UnsupportedEventContext`). Quick reference: [cheat-sheet.md](cheat-sheet.md). The `every` block here maps a literal to show the form. Carry a timestamp on the event with `$context.occurred` in the producing command when a view must show it.
