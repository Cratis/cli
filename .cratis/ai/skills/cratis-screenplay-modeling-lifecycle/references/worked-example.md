# Worked example: reasoning description, constraint, decided rejection

A marina berth allocation feature. The feature `description` carries the reasoning (scope, an
assumption tied to Q1, a rule kept as a constraint). The refusal for a boat that already holds a
berth is a specification, not a note. Complete and compiling with the standalone compiler and with
`cratis screenplay validate`.


```screenplay

## Why it is shaped this way
- The one-berth-per-boat rule (`unique boat` across berth event sources) is a constraint with a pinned message, so the competing-claim
  specification can state the exact rejection. No `BerthReassigned` event was added to carry it.
- The `Cannot` line in the persona resolves to the `HarbourOffice` policy and a `then denied`
  specification whose caller fixture carries a non-matching role.
- Assumption Q1 lives in the feature description and in STATE.md (Open questions) with its address,
  `Berths.Allocation`.
- The description is rationale only: the rules themselves are enforced by the constraint, the policy
  and the specifications, not by the prose.
- The constraint does not say a berth holds one boat at a time: a berth source may replace its
  claimed boat. If berth occupancy must be unique too, model and specify that as its own invariant.
