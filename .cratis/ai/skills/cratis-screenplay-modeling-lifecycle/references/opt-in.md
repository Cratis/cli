# Opt-in evidence

The decision rule is in `SKILL.md` ("Decide the level first"). This file holds the evidence.

## Why an empty directory or an MCP entry is not opt-in
At cratis CLI `v3.27.1` the `cratis/screenplay` profile (and composed profiles such as Stage)
makes `cratis ai install`/`update` create the selected model directory, normally the corpus
default `.cratis/screenplay` (`Documentation/ai/index.md`: "Install/update creates the selected
empty model directory ... but does not start the server or create source files"), and register
a Screenplay MCP entry for it. Uninstall keeps the directory. Both therefore appear in every
repository that merely installed the language skills, so neither can signal consent.

## The explicit signal
`mcpServers.screenplay.root` in `.cratis/ai.json` is the project-owned property that overrides the
model directory (`Documentation/reference/screenplay-mcp.md` at `v3.27.1`: "The optional
project-owned `mcpServers` property in `.cratis/ai.json` overrides the model directory or
disables registration"; `AiConfiguration.McpServers`, read by `AiMcpDescriptor` as
`configuration.McpServers?.GetValueOrDefault(Id)?.Root ?? DefaultRoot`). Verify with
`git -C <cli checkout> show v3.27.1:Documentation/reference/screenplay-mcp.md`.

## Edge cases
- `.play` files only under `.ai-work/`, a docs folder or a sample: not under the root, so not opt-in.
- Acceptance is visible in the repository: the model root holds at least one `.play` file in
  the committed tree (`git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD -- <root>` lists it). Committing a model
  under the root is the team's act of acceptance and opts the repository in. P6 commits the
  accepted `.play` files and `.screenplay/identities.json` when present.
- Staged or untracked files under the root are drafts: they do not opt the repository in and
  are not a contract for code agents. The modeler writes drafts into the root as before; they
  stay drafts until committed. A local STATE.md alone proves nothing to another clone.
- A committed file with uncommitted working-tree edits is a model change in progress. Its HEAD
  version is the contract until the change is committed; `git diff --quiet HEAD -- <file>`
  detects whether the working copy differs.
- An explicitly configured root (`mcpServers.screenplay.root`) that is empty still counts as
  opted in; rule (b) is independent of rule (a).
- Declined proposals: a team that wants a lasting "no model" answer writes it in its own
  repository instructions, never in managed corpus files.

## Acceptance test cases
Assume no other committed `.play` file under the root and no explicit root configuration,
except in the last row. A committed model is a contract only for the slice it covers.

| Case under the model root | Opted in? | Contract for code agents |
|---|---|---|
| Untracked `.play` file | No | None; draft |
| Staged-only `.play` file, absent from HEAD | No | None; draft |
| Committed `.play` file | Yes | Its HEAD version |
| Committed `.play` file with working-tree edits | Yes | Its HEAD version; edits are a model change in progress until committed |
| Explicitly configured empty root | Yes | None yet; model the slice first |
