# Phases: Input, Carry-forward, Gate

Every phase uses the same template, adapted from the per-step "Input / Output to carry forward /
Gate" structure of the TrogonStack orchestrating skill (see `provenance.md`). Owners are roles:
the **main session** orchestrates and owns the MCP connection while it is the identity owner;
the **Screenplay Modeler** agent models and extracts legacy systems; the **Screenplay Reviewer**
(read-only) reviews and explains; the **Screenplay Renderer** probes and verifies delivery.
Where a harness has no such agents, the main session plays the roles one at a time, never mixing
modeling and critic stance in one pass. Subagents do not spawn subagents. One authoring agent per
model root at a time; parallel work is read-only or on separate roots.

## Phase transition protocol
Before loading the next phase skill, overwrite STATE.md (`handoff-template.md`):
1. what was done (changed declarations, gate result, verdict lines at the current source identity);
2. carry-forward for the next phase (the items below);
3. open questions with address and assumption in use;
4. the next phase and the skill it loads.
Add one Interview Trail row (phase, skill, status, key output). Then load the next skill. A phase
whose gate fails stays open; it is never "carried" into the next one.

Phase summary block, appended under Carry-forward in STATE.md after every phase and before the
next skill loads (never skipped, also after a small change):
```markdown
### P<n> complete - <skill>
- **What was done**: 2-4 bullets: artifacts changed (addresses), decisions made, gates passed
- **Carry-forward**: what the next phase needs from this one
- **Open questions**: anything unresolved or deferred, each with its address and assumption
```
The Interview Trail row's status becomes `done` and its key output one line. Also record, at any
phase, a decision important enough that a later reader could misread the model (see
`reasoning-notes.md` for when it belongs in a `description`).

## P0 Intake
- **Input**: the request, the repository, `.cratis/screenplay/` or the configured root.
- **Carry-forward**: mode; model root; tool check (versions per `cratis-screenplay-toolchain`);
  the decision-rule outcome (model or code-first); STATE.md.
- **Gate**: mode stated; STATE.md exists; the five intake points (domain, source, goal, constraints,
  starting point) settled or recorded as assumptions.

## P1 Discover (`cratis-screenplay-discovery`; modeling stance)
- **Input**: the user, documents, existing `.play`.
- **Carry-forward**: personas with purpose; modules and features; past-tense events in story order
  with terminal states; rules register and denial candidates; open questions.
- **Gate**: every in-scope workflow has events in a feature ending in named terminal states; every
  persona has a purpose; rules register and denial candidates listed; naming pass done (no generic
  edit events); open questions logged.
- **Skip when**: an existing model already covers the workflow (change entry).

## P2 Model (`cratis-screenplay-slice-design`, `-streams-and-consistency`, `-automations-and-translations`)
- **Input**: the P1 model.
- **Carry-forward**: slices with commands (reachable, authorized origins), events, read models with
  projections and queries, screens, reactions and captures, consistency decisions, slice dependencies.
- **Gate**: V1 clean after the batch; every command has a reachable, authorized origin; every screen
  data need is served by a read model; every field has a known origin.
- **Skip when**: no reactions, schedules or outside facts are in scope (automations); event-source
  identity, destinations, constraints, stored-state decisions, retries and persisted-contract
  evolution are absent or already verified and unchanged (streams). Command count is not the criterion.

## P3 Specify (`cratis-screenplay-scenario-coverage`; modeling stance)
- **Input**: the P2 model.
- **Carry-forward**: coverage matrix, specifications, then reasoning descriptions for features with
  real decisions (`reasoning-notes.md`).
- **Gate**: matrix written before drafting; per command each applicable scenario type is a spec or
  "n/a" with a domain reason (one success plus one failure is not coverage); each gated command and
  query, including those under an inherited module or feature `authorize`, has its own `then denied`
  spec with a caller fixture carrying the persona's roles or claims; each `produces when` has a spec
  per branch; each value-unique constraint has a competing-claim spec; per read model a view spec, an
  update spec when several sources feed it, a removal or absence spec when it removes. A command-only
  pass fails the gate.

## P4 Self-check (`cratis-screenplay-model-review`, self-check; critic stance)
- **Input**: the P3 model including reasoning descriptions.
- **Carry-forward**: five verdict lines from fresh runs; the completeness walk; findings by tier.
- **Gate**: completeness walk done (field origins, event consumers or terminal reasons); every gap
  fixed, accepted by the user, or an open question with its assumption. The critic reports; fixes go
  in a separate modeling batch, then V1 is rerun on the changed revision.

## P5 Independent review (`cratis-screenplay-model-review`)
- **Input**: the handoff packet, the source identity, every author's model (or `model: not exposed`).
- **Carry-forward**: findings (critical, major, minor) with tier; PASS, WARN or FAIL; business
  questions; the reviewer's own model.
- **Gate**: no critical finding; majors fixed or accepted by the user; at most 2 fix rounds. A
  same-model review is labelled as such; the user decides whether it is enough.

## P6 Accept (the user)
- **Input**: the reviewed source identity.
- **Carry-forward**: the accepted **source identity** (`verdicts-and-modes.md`).
- **Commit at P6**: the accepted `.play` files and `.screenplay/identities.json` when present.
  The user commits, or explicitly authorizes the owning session to commit; the modeler never
  commits on its own. Committing a model under the model root is the team's act of acceptance
  and opts the repository in (`git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD -- <root>` lists the `.play`
  file). Staged or untracked files under the root are drafts, not contracts for code agents.
  A committed file with working-tree edits is a model change in progress; its HEAD version is
  the contract until the change is committed.
- **Gate**: explicit acceptance and the model commit before P7-P9. After committing, recompute
  the source identity. Its digest must equal the digest reviewed at P5; only the commit part may
  differ. If the digest differs, return to P4/P5 for the changed scope. Record the post-commit
  identity only after this check passes. Any later edit to the scope invalidates that identity's acceptance; it
  does not replace the HEAD contract until committed.

## P7 Execute (executable mode; modeling stance)
- **Input**: the accepted identity.
- **Carry-forward**: V3, and V4 where a route exists.
- **Gate**: V3 ready; V4 result or "V4 not run: no route". Specs written or bound is never "specs pass".
- **Skip when**: design mode.

## P8 Render or fall back (`cratis-screenplay-render-and-gap-fill`)
- **Input**: the accepted identity.
- **Carry-forward**: the admission result; render output and named gaps in `Customizations/`;
  non-renderable scope handed to a code agent with the model as contract, plus a fallback record
  naming the blocking codes. Automations and translations are not rendered at the pinned Stage version, so the whole behavior is gap-fill. Three cases stay distinct: admission failure (nothing rendered); an
  existing generated base plus separately authorized gap-fill; fully hand-written delivery.
- **Gate**: V5 sub-results, or a fallback entry per non-renderable scope. A customization never
  makes a rejected model renderable; no whole-application V5 from a subset.
- **Skip when**: no code is wanted.

## P9 Verify
- **Input**: rendered or hand-written output.
- **Carry-forward**: Debug build and tests mapped to spec classes; drift check; for gap-fill, the
  conformance result (`cratis-application-slice-conformance`).
- **Gate**: all gates green or honestly reported as not run, with the reason.
- **Drift**: compare successive render manifests (`semanticRevision`) produced with the same
  inputs, `--name` and toolchain; never the MCP `modelRevision` against a manifest
  (`verdicts-and-modes.md`). Equal revisions do not prove customization conformance or faithful UI.

No other phase is skipped. P3-P5 scale to the change but always run for semantic edits.

## Entry points for changes to an existing model
| Change | Enter at | Then |
|---|---|---|
| New or changed slice, member, rule, read model | P2 | P3 for affected specs, P4, scoped P5 |
| Specs only | P3 | P4, scoped P5 |
| Rename, move, remove, contract evolution | P2 by the identity owner | typed proposal, diff, apply (the request that named the change is the approval); P3-P5 for impact |
| Review request | P5 | report only |
| Executable or render request on an accepted model | P7 / P8 | P9 |
| Question from a running Chronicle system | read-only `cratis-chronicle-cli-operations` | update the model at P2 if needed |

## Resume mid-workflow
1. Read STATE.md only, not old transcripts.
2. Recompute the source identity and compare. If it moved, rerun V1 and re-orient before trusting
   recorded verdicts.
3. Continue at the recorded next phase; carry open questions and assumptions forward.

## Final output of a modeling engagement
Personas with purpose; modules and features; events in story order; commands with origins; read
models and screens; consistency decisions; automations and translations; specifications with the
coverage matrix; open questions with assumptions; the five verdict lines; the review result; the
accepted source identity. A design-mode engagement lists what a later executable or renderable
mode would still need.

## Quality checklist (closing)
- [ ] Every phase either ran its gate or recorded its skip condition.
- [ ] Every persona has a purpose and every Cannot line resolves to an executable gate and a `then denied` spec, or is recorded as a gap.
- [ ] Every command has a reachable, authorized origin and at least one refusal where it can refuse.
- [ ] Every read model serves a screen or a processor; every field has an origin and a destination.
- [ ] Every decided rejection is a specification; every open question has an address and an assumption.
- [ ] No generic edit events; no rule exists only in a `description`.
- [ ] Five verdict lines, each a result or "not run: <reason>".
- [ ] Independent review done or labelled; acceptance bound to a source identity.
- [ ] STATE.md current; the packet opens with `Outcome:`.
- [ ] Nothing weakened to pass a tool; gaps recorded.

## Legacy entry (replaces P1-P2)
Owner: Screenplay Modeler with `cratis-screenplay-legacy-extraction`; a read-only exploration agent
for code sweeps; `cratis-chronicle-cli-operations` for Chronicle runtime facts only.
- **L0 Inventory**: stacks, entry points, data stores, omitted entry points.
- **L1 Static evidence**: `cratis screenplay generate` into `.ai-work/screenplay/<model-slug>/legacy/`.
- **L2 Dynamic evidence**: Prologue capture; approval naming the target.
- **L3 Evidence table**: each row intent, consequence, infrastructure or unknown, with file:line or
  capture reference. Absence of observation is not absence of behavior.
- **L4 Intentional model**: re-sliced by business decision; as-is evidence kept apart from target
  decisions (keep, change, remove); loss report; expert questions.
Then P3 (every command gets a success spec and a denial spec where gated), P4, P5, expert
verification with the user, P6. Recovered code and observations are evidence, never automatic truth.
