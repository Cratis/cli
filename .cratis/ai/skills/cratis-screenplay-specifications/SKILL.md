description: Pin behavior in a Cratis Screenplay `.play` model with given/when/then `specification` blocks — prior events and read-model state, the caller, the command or appended event under test, expected events, read-model state, query results, rejections and denials, plus what the reference execution actually runs. Use when writing acceptance criteria for a slice, specifying a rejection or an authorization denial, or deciding whether a rule belongs in a specification or in the type system. Do not use for C# or TypeScript test code.

# Screenplay specifications

A `specification` is the acceptance criterion for a slice, written in the same
document as the behavior it pins. Given/when/then, in business language, with
concrete data.

## Locate the model

Look first in `.cratis/screenplay/` at the repository root. This is the
conventional home for consumer-owned `.play` source; do not invent another
location or search the whole repository before checking it.

`cratis ai install` manages `.cratis/ai/`, not `.cratis/screenplay/`. Never
hand-copy Screenplay source between repositories. Keep Markdown that explains,
questions or navigates the model in the repository's documentation; the `.play`
source is the single flow model.

## Verified product sources

| Package | Version | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Cratis.Screenplay` | `4.31.0` | Original parser, binder and reference execution evidence |
| `Cratis.Screenplay` | main `fd18129` | Inline facts, `optional` and clock spelling; changed examples compiled |
| `Cratis.Screenplay` | `4.64.0` (`7e16162`) | ESM v6 specification actions and reaction cascades, `then no readmodel`, `$strings` rejections, `invokes` caller rule; probed with the standalone tool and its MCP server |

The update follows `commands.md`, `events.md`, `types.md` and
`specifications.md` at that main commit (after v4.52.0). This pass compiles the
changed examples; it does not rerun the reference runner.

**Which tool says what.** The standalone `screenplay` tool 4.64.0 admits ESM v1-v6.
The `cratis` CLI 3.27.1 bundles Screenplay 4.60.1, which admits ESM v1-v5 only and
reports a false `PLAY0285` on reaction cascades (see "Version skew"). Facts below
marked **ESM v6** hold for the standalone tool from 4.61.0 and for `cratis` only
after it bundles a newer compiler. The full table is in `cratis-screenplay-toolchain`
(`references/versions.md`). Neither tool runs specifications: `screenplay` and
`cratis screenplay validate` parse and check consistency, the MCP server also binds,
and spec outcomes come only from the reference runner as a library, Stage's
specification runner or a rendered application's tests.

Checked against the Screenplay repository at tag `v4.31.0` (commit `355dffb`):
`Documentation/screenplay/{specifications,policies,constraints,readmodels,diagnostics}.md`.
The original worked example had reference-runner evidence at that tag. The
example below now uses inline events and canonical optionality; keep its current
compile check distinct from that historical execution evidence.

The specification actions beyond commands (`given clock`, `when clock`,
`when trigger`, `given capture`, `when capture`, `when query`, `then result`,
`then no result`) were checked against tag `v4.48.0` (commit `3baf4a4`):
`Documentation/screenplay/{specifications,diagnostics}.md` and the proposed
decision 0022. They do not exist before v4.48.0.

## The vocabulary

| Construct | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `given <EventType>` | prior state, established by replaying events before the action |
| `given readmodel <ReadModelType>` | prior read-model state, established directly — a **complete** instance including its identifier |
| `given caller` | the caller: `authenticated`, `role "<r>"`, repeatable `claim "<type>" = "<value>"`; empty means unauthenticated |
| `when <CommandType>` | run a command |
| `when append <EventType>` | append one event: constraints and projections run, the command does not; reactions run only from ESM v6, where `then` lists what followed |
| `when query <Query>` | perform a query with the argument values beneath it (v4.48.0) |
| `then result [exactly]` | one expected row of the performed query; repeat for several (v4.48.0) |
| `then no result` | the performed query returns nothing (v4.48.0) |
| `given clock "<instant>"` | the ISO 8601 instant the scenario happens at (v4.48.0) |
| `when clock "<instant>"` | the clock reaches an instant; scheduled reactions that are due run (v4.48.0) |
| `when trigger <Trigger>` | an application trigger fires with the values beneath it (v4.48.0) |
| `given capture` / `when capture <Capture>` | an earlier and the current record of a capture's source (v4.48.0) |
| `then <EventType>` | an expected new event |
| `then events in any order` | compare the new events without regard to order |
| `then readmodel <ReadModelType> [exactly]` | read-model state afterwards — must state the identifier |
| `then no readmodel <ReadModelType> for <key>` | exactly that keyed instance is absent (v4.64.0); the key is concrete and typed |
| `then query <Query> [exactly]` | query results for explicit `arguments`; one `result` per row; none means empty |
| `then error "<message>"` | a validation or constraint rejection, for that reason; a localized rule is pinned by its quoted key, `then error "$strings.<key>"` |
| `then error` | a validation or constraint rejection, reason unnamed |
| `then denied` | an authorization denial (`Unauthorized`) |
| `for <value>` | the event source of a `given`/`then` event, or of the `when` command or appended event |
| `<property> = <value>` | a literal, `null`, or a one-line JSON-shaped object or list: `lines = [{"sku":"A-1","quantity":2}]` |

From v4.48.0 an enumeration value binds whether it is written bare
(`status = sent`), qualified (`status = InvoiceStatus.sent`) or quoted, and a
`DateTime` value binds as a plain ISO 8601 instant (`"2026-10-05T08:00:00Z"`).
Before v4.48.0 only the quoted member and the full round-trip instant
(`"2026-10-05T08:00:00.0000000Z"`) bound, although the compiler accepted all of
them - quote members when a model must bind on older versions.

Rules the binder enforces:

- **At most one action** — a command, `when append`, `when clock`, `when trigger`,
  `when capture` or `when query` (`PLAY0097`, `PLAY0358`). Without an action,
  assert only `then readmodel`, `then no readmodel` or `then query` (`PLAY0352`).
- **`then result` and `then no result` need `when query`**, and `when query`
  needs one of them or `then denied` (`PLAY0465`). Each argument is a `by` or
  `filter` parameter of the query (`PLAY0468`).
- **A clock instant is ISO 8601 with an offset or `Z`**, such as
  `"2026-10-05T08:00:00Z"` (`PLAY0461`); `given clock` appears at most once.
- **`then` contains either events or an error — never both.** A rejection
  specification has exactly one rejection and no success outcome.
- **`then denied` stands alone**: not with events, errors or state assertions
  (`PLAY0388`). For a query, pair it with one `then query` that has `arguments`
  and no `result`.
- **Authorized commands and queries need `given caller`** (`PLAY0389`). The runner
  never invents a caller.
- **`null` only in optional read-model values.** A `null` in a command or event
  value is `PLAY0350`: an optional fact is a separate event.

`PLAY0358` is a syntax error. `PLAY0350`, `PLAY0352`, `PLAY0388`, `PLAY0389` and
the one-rejection rule (`PLAY0273`) are reported only when the model binds, so
`screenplay --warnaserror` does not show them. Check executable diagnostics
(the MCP authoring tools) as well.

## How outcomes are compared

- **Events:** the complete set of new events, in authored order, unless
  `then events in any order` is stated. The count is always exact. After
  `when append`, a model before ESM v6 expects the appended fact itself; from
  ESM v6 the appended event is the action and `then` lists only what followed it.
- **Read models and query rows:** only the asserted properties must match
  (subset); add `exactly` to require every property. Row count and order are
  always exact. A missing property does not match an asserted `null`.
- **Rejections:** `then error "<message>"` matches the message whatever the rule's
  validation severity; no form asserts severity. Bare `then error` never matches
  a denial. Quote a localized key: `then error "$strings.invoices.reasonRequired"`.
  The grammar takes only quoted messages here, never an unquoted `$strings` token
  (unlike a rule's `message` operand). The reference runner compares the symbolic key
  and requires the rejection to carry the string-key marker; it never loads
  translated text; resolving the key is the realization's job.

## Worked example

A command with an authorization gate, a validation rule and a uniqueness
constraint, and a read model fed by its event. The `for` values select ESM v2.

```

- Inline events are ordinary named facts in `given` and `then`. Assert their
  destination with `for`, not a payload identifier; inline declaration does not
  change fixture or assertion syntax.
- `RejectingANumberAnotherInvoiceHolds` needs `for`: without it the `given`
  event lands on the command's own event source, and re-claiming your own value
  is not a violation.
- `ProjectingAnAppendedInvoice` exercises the projection without running the
  command. A `when append` specification may sit in a `StateView` slice, even for an
  event another slice declares, as long as the event's producer gives it one
  unambiguous destination type (binding resolves it from commands in other slices);
  otherwise `for` fails with `PLAY0273`. Only `when <Command>` needs the command's
  own slice.
- `LookingUpAnExistingInvoice` performs the query as its action. It binds to
  exactly what `then query` with `arguments` and `result` would, so on a version
  before v4.48.0 write it that way instead.

## Actions beyond commands

A slice is not always set off by a command. Name what does:

| Slice | Action |
| --- | --- |
| A view no event builds - its query has a `performer` | `given readmodel` …, `when query <Query>`, `then result` / `then no result` |
| An automation driven by the clock | `given clock "<instant>"`, `when clock "<later instant>"` |
| An automation driven by an application trigger | `when trigger <Trigger>` with the values it carries |
| A translation driven by a capture | `given capture <Capture>` (the record as it was), `when capture <Capture>` (as it is now) |

Use `given clock`, never `given time`, to state the scenario occurrence time and
assert a value mapped from `$context.occurred`. In a command's `produces`, that
mapping executes when the scenario has `given clock`. It is not the same as
`$eventContext.occurred` in a projection, which the execution plan refuses (below).

**Which tools bind these actions** (probed: the standalone `screenplay mcp` 4.64.0
reports the complete example below `executableReady` with no executable error, in
`open-workspace` readiness and `read-workspace` view `executable-diagnostics`;
`cratis` 3.27.1 bundles 4.60.1 and does not):

- **Standalone tool, Screenplay 4.64.0 (ESM v6, from 4.61.0):** the clock, trigger
  and capture actions, and the `Automation` and `Translate` slices, reactions and
  captures they drive, bind. The reference runner executes them as library code, with
  the semantics in "Reactions and cascades" below.
- **`cratis` 3.27.1 (Screenplay 4.60.1, ESM v1-v5):**
  **`when query` executes today. The clock, trigger and capture actions do not.** They parse, print and are
  checked against the application, but binding reports `PLAY0268` naming the
  proposed ESM v6 (decision 0022), and an `Automation` or `Translate` slice reports
  *is not admitted by ESM v1*. Only binding shows this: `cratis screenplay validate`
  does not bind, so it stays green.

Write the actions either way - they state what sets the slice off. Report each as
bound and not executed, or as parsed only, naming the tool that said so.

## Reactions and cascades (ESM v6)

From ESM v6 every action sets reactions off: after a command, an append, a clock
tick, a trigger or a capture record, each new fact runs the reactions to its event,
and what those append or invoke runs more, until nothing is left. `then` events
compare every new fact, the action's and the reactions'.

```screenplay
// Needs the standalone screenplay compiler (ESM v6)
concept InvoiceId : Uuid
module Collections
  feature Invoices
    slice StateChange SendInvoice
      command SendInvoice
        invoiceId InvoiceId identifier
        produces InvoiceSent
          for invoiceId
          invoiceId = invoiceId
      event InvoiceSent
        invoiceId InvoiceId
      specification SendingAnInvoiceSchedulesAReminder
        given clock "2026-10-02T09:00:00Z"
        when SendInvoice
          invoiceId = "9c858901-8a57-4791-81fe-4c455b099bc9"
        then InvoiceSent
          for "9c858901-8a57-4791-81fe-4c455b099bc9"
          invoiceId = "9c858901-8a57-4791-81fe-4c455b099bc9"
        then ReminderScheduled
          for "9c858901-8a57-4791-81fe-4c455b099bc9"
          scheduledAt = "2026-10-02T09:00:00Z"
    slice Automation Reminders
      reaction ReminderScheduler
        description "Schedules a reminder when an invoice is sent"
        when InvoiceSent
          invoiceId
          produces ReminderScheduled
            for invoiceId
            scheduledAt = $context.occurred
      event ReminderScheduled
        scheduledAt DateTime
```

- A specification whose action is a command goes in the slice that declares that
  command, here `SendInvoice`, not in the `Automation` slice that reacts: a command
  from another slice is `PLAY0273` "command is unresolved in its slice" at binding.
- A command a reaction `invokes` runs through its full pipeline **with no caller**.
  A command that needs one rejects, and that rejection ends the scenario. Each
  invoked command is atomic; the cascade is not, so earlier accepted facts stay.
  There is no syntax for an identity (Screenplay#383). See
  `cratis-screenplay-automations-and-translations` and
  `cratis-screenplay-captures-and-reactions`.
- The clock is UTC and exact. An `every` or `at` occurrence fires once when it is
  due after `given clock` and at or before `when clock`; `when clock` needs
  `given clock`, so the same instant twice fires nothing.
- A reached reaction with a code body (`file` or inline) returns unsupported, as
  does a reaction that never settles. The reference stops at 1,000 new facts per
  scenario and 10,000 due occurrences per clock advance.
- A model that uses these forms selects ESM v6 (`schemaVersion: 6`). Stage 4.24.0
  admits ESM v1-v3 and renders no `Automation` or `Translate` slice, so the whole
  automation is gap-fill against this contract: `cratis-screenplay-render-and-gap-fill`.

### Version skew: cascades and the false `PLAY0285`

`PLAY0285` (a specification's expected event contradicts every producer of its
`when` command) runs in the syntax pass, with no binding. Reachability through
reactions and `invokes` was added after Screenplay 4.60.1. So the example above
passes `screenplay` 4.64.0 (and is executable-ready over its MCP server) and fails `cratis screenplay
validate` 3.27.1 with `PLAY0285` "Specification outcome 'ReminderScheduled' cannot be
produced by 'SendInvoice'", exit 5 (Cratis/cli#242, open). It is a tool skew, not a
modeling error: do not delete the `then` line or move the event to make `cratis`
green. Validate with the standalone tool, record which tool gave which verdict, and
see `cratis-screenplay-toolchain`.

## Rejections and denials say different things

`then error "<message>"` says **rejected, for this reason** — pin it when the
message is the point. Bare `then error` says **rejected, for a reason this
specification does not name**; the reason lives in the specification's name.
`then denied` says **this caller may not do this**, which is decided before any
validation runs. Write the bare form rather than `then error ""`.

**Views cannot reject events.** A projection never refuses an event; there are no
error cases for one. (A `when append` can still be refused by an append-time
constraint — that is the constraint speaking, not the view.)

## Business rule or concept rule?

Before writing an error specification, sort the rule:

1. Does the error depend on **existing system state** - what events occurred?
   → business rule → write the specification.
2. Would a different business plausibly have a different rule here?
   → business rule → write the specification.
3. Is it a format, range or presence rule on a single value?
   → put it on the **concept** with its own `validate` block, so the rule travels
   with every use, and write **one rejection specification per concept rule**,
   through **one** command that uses the concept. Not one per command or property
   that uses it.

**Write specifications for:** *"Cannot cancel an already-paid invoice"*,
*"Cannot withdraw more than the balance"*, *"Maximum 100 lines per invoice"*, and,
once per concept rule, *"Discount cannot exceed 100 percent"*.

**Do not write** one specification per use of a concept, or one per format variant
of the same rule.

**Why this differs from earlier guidance.** This skill used to say not to write
specifications for rules like *"Name cannot be empty"* because the type system
makes them unrepresentable. In Screenplay a concept `validate` is a runtime rule the
reference runner executes, not a type-level guarantee . Without a
rejection specification nothing proves the rule is wired to the command, and a
rule moved or deleted by an edit goes unnoticed. The cost is one specification per
rule; the rule stays on the concept, never copied into each command.

A complete example: the rule lives on the concept, one command exercises it, and
each concept rule has a rejection (the boundary above the limit and the rule below
zero), plus an acceptance at the limit.

```screenplay
concept InvoiceId : Uuid
concept DiscountPercentage : Int
  validate
    min 0 message "Discount cannot be negative"
    max 100 message "Discount cannot exceed 100 percent"
module Invoicing
  feature Discounts
    slice StateChange GrantDiscount
      command GrantDiscount
        invoiceId InvoiceId identifier
        discount  DiscountPercentage
        produces event DiscountGranted
          discount DiscountPercentage = discount
      specification GrantingAValidDiscount
        when GrantDiscount
          invoiceId = "9c858901-8a57-4791-81fe-4c455b099bc9"
          discount  = 15
        then DiscountGranted
          for "9c858901-8a57-4791-81fe-4c455b099bc9"
          discount = 15
      specification AcceptingTheUpperBoundary
        when GrantDiscount
          invoiceId = "9c858901-8a57-4791-81fe-4c455b099bc9"
          discount  = 100
        then DiscountGranted
          for "9c858901-8a57-4791-81fe-4c455b099bc9"
          discount = 100
      specification RejectingADiscountAboveTheUpperBoundary
        when GrantDiscount
          invoiceId = "9c858901-8a57-4791-81fe-4c455b099bc9"
          discount  = 101
        then error "Discount cannot exceed 100 percent"
      specification RejectingANegativeDiscount
        when GrantDiscount
          invoiceId = "9c858901-8a57-4791-81fe-4c455b099bc9"
          discount  = -1
        then error "Discount cannot be negative"
```

Which scenarios a command needs (denial, duplicates, competing claims, ordering,
external failure, compensation) and which form fits a mode: coverage-matrix and
workshop method in `cratis-screenplay-scenario-coverage`. This skill stays the
grammar and the reference-execution facts.

## Application-boundary coverage

Every slice should carry at least one specification whose action is what a real
caller does and whose `then` is observable at that same boundary — produced
events, read-model state, query results, a rejection or a denial. A specification
satisfiable only by an internal function describes a unit, not a slice acceptance
criterion.

## Reference execution — what actually runs

Screenplay's reference runner executes specifications against an immutable
in-memory world: no Arc, no Chronicle, no database, no network. Every downstream
target has one normalized behavior to match.

- It runs the capabilities the execution plan admits: declarative validation
  and `require` over command properties, conditional production, literal tags,
  declarative policies, `unique` constraints, and projections as Chronicle
  lowers them. The `cratis-screenplay-model-authoring` language reference lists
  what binds and what the plan admits.
- Binding is not admission. These projection constructs bind, but the plan
  refuses them: a projection-level `remove via join`; `all` beside removals,
  `children` or `nested`; a `join`, `children` or `remove via join` inside
  `nested`; and any `$eventContext.<path>` other than `eventSourceId`, such as
  `$eventContext.occurred`. The limits apply at every ESM version.
- A specification that needs **opaque code** — a bodied reducer, a rule with a
  body, a fenced `validate` block, a code policy, or (ESM v6) a reached reaction
  body — returns **unsupported** and
  never passes. Authorization is evaluated first, so a `then denied` case still
  runs when a portable policy decides it. Other specifications in the model run
  normally.
- Unsupported reachable declarative constructs block the whole execution plan
  rather than running partially: no specification in the model runs, including
  the ones that never touch the refused construct.
- Reactions: before ESM v6 they never run, not even after `when append`. From ESM
  v6 (standalone tool from 4.61.0) they run after every action, as in "Reactions and
  cascades". Under `cratis` 3.27.1 (Screenplay 4.60.1) `when clock`, `when trigger`
  and `when capture` fail binding with `PLAY0268`, and so do reactions and captures.
- A rejected individual command or append leaves the world unchanged; an accepted
  one commits once, then the read models and queries are compared. There is no
  scenario-wide transaction in v6: when a later effect of a cascade or capture
  rejects, the earlier accepted facts and their projections remain.

Unsupported is not passed. Report it as "needs a target", not as green. "Specified"
and "bound" are never "passing": no command-line tool runs these specifications, so a
pass is claimed only from the reference runner, Stage's specification runner or a
rendered application's tests, and named as such.

## Quality checklist

For every specification:

- [ ] Concrete, realistic values — never "valid user" or "some amount".
- [ ] Tests exactly one behavior, independent of other specifications.
- [ ] Business language matching the event-model vocabulary.

For command specifications:

- [ ] Every `given` event and the `when` command state all required fields.
- [ ] `given caller` is present whenever the command is authorized, with a
      `then denied` case for a caller who must be refused.
- [ ] `then` contains **either** events **or** an error, never both.
- [ ] A collision between two event sources uses `for` on the `given` event.
- [ ] Error cases test business rules; each concept rule has one rejection
      specification through one command, not one per use.
- [ ] A localized rejection is pinned by its quoted `$strings` key.

For view specifications:

- [ ] A view a `performer` composes is specified with `given readmodel`,
      `when query` and `then result` or `then no result`.
- [ ] `given readmodel` is a complete instance with its identifier.
- [ ] `then readmodel` states the identifier and the properties that matter; add
      `exactly` only when extra properties must fail the assertion.
- [ ] No error cases — views cannot reject.

## Verify

- [ ] `screenplay <model> --warnaserror` reports zero errors and zero warnings
      (standalone 4.64.0; under `cratis` 3.27.1 expect the false `PLAY0285` on
      reaction cascades and record that it is skew).
- [ ] Executable diagnostics are clean too: `PLAY0350`, `PLAY0352`, `PLAY0388`,
      `PLAY0389` and `PLAY0273` are only reported at binding.
- [ ] Every slice has at least one boundary specification.
- [ ] The rejections and denials are specified, not only the happy path.
- [ ] No `given`/`when`/`then` clause names an element the model does not declare.
- [ ] An unsupported run is reported as unsupported, never as passing.
