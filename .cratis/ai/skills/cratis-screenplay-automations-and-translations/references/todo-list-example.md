# Example: a todo-list automation

A complete model: a result opens a work item, a reaction invokes a command, the command's fact
closes the item. It binds on Screenplay 4.64.0 (`executableReady: true`); the cratis 3.27.1
bundled compiler (Screenplay 4.60.1) rejects the Automation slice at binding with PLAY0268. Versions: `cratis-screenplay-toolchain` `references/versions.md`.

The first spec lists the whole cascade (`then` names every new fact: `CoursePassed`, and
`CertificateSent` through the reaction), and `given clock` supplies the instant that
`$context.occurred` needs. The cratis 3.27.1 bundled compiler reports a false PLAY0285 on that
cascade (cli#242), so the fence carries the standalone-compiler marker. These specs were not
run (V4: not run, no route); the expectations follow the v4.64.0 reference semantics.

What the model proves and what it does not:

- Proven by the model: one `CertificateSent` per enrolment (`unique event`), the queue opening
  and closing, a gated `RecordCompletion` that refuses non-coordinators.
- Not proven: that the certificate email reaches the person once. See
  `references/effects-and-idempotency.md`.
- The actor behind `SendCertificate` is a recorded security decision in the `Certification`
  module `description`, because reaction invocations carry no caller today (Screenplay#383).
- No local engine runs Automation specifications: report them as authored, not as run.

```screenplay
// Needs the standalone screenplay compiler (ESM v6)
// Todo-list automation. Shape: CoursePassed opens an item -> CertificateSender invokes
// SendCertificate -> CertificateSent closes the item. The once-only FACT is
// `unique event CertificateSent`; the external send is NOT proven once-only by this model.

## Design-only additions

Two things a real queue often wants do not bind on 4.64.0 and stay out of the complete model
above: a list query (the visible queue) and a retry sweep that reads the whole view. Both parse
(V1) and report PLAY0268 at binding; durable per-item fan-out is outside the language
(Screenplay#286). Keep them in the model only when the document is the deliverable and say so
in the verdict.

```screenplay excerpt
// Parent: the complete document above, slice StateView CertificatesToSend.
query PendingCertificates => PendingCertificate[]
```

```screenplay excerpt
// Parent: the complete document above, slice Automation SendCertificates, after CertificateSender.
// The sweep reads the whole view (a clock trigger takes no `by`); iterating items needs code.
reaction CertificateRetrySweep
  description "Retries items still pending; per-item fan-out needs code today (#286)"
  every 15 minutes
    reads PendingCertificate
    file Reactions/RetryPendingCertificates.cs
```

`reads` documents what a trigger consults; it never protects (a trigger with `reads` that
`produces` directly fails binding: decide in a command instead).
