# Example: a Translate slice

A complete model: a webhook record from an outside proctoring service is captured, kept as an
external fact in the provider's vocabulary, then translated by reactions into our facts. It
binds on Screenplay 4.64.0 (`executableReady: true`); the cratis 3.27.1 bundled compiler
(Screenplay 4.60.1) compiles it (V1) but rejects the Translate slice at binding (PLAY0268).

Read the slice `description`: it is the per-field disposition (map, translate, ignore) and it
states what this example does not do. Examples never show the whole integration contract; use
`references/integration-contracts.md` and `references/worked-integration.md` for the rest.

```screenplay
// Translate slice. Correlation is created on OUR side: BookExam allocates the attempt id and the
// realization hands it to the proctoring service as its reference; the service's webhook echoes
// it, so the capture `key` lands every record on the attempt's own stream. The external fact keeps
// the provider's vocabulary (ProctorResultReceived); translator reactions record our facts.

      description "Per external field: reference -> correlation key (our attempt id, echoed); outcome -> translated to our enum; score -> kept; examinerNote -> ignored (free text, may hold personal data, no consumer). Repeated delivery: this example compares outcome only. An unchanged outcome appends nothing, even if the score changed, so it does not implement score corrections. OneResultPerAttempt refuses a second local result. Changed outcomes and score-only corrections need an explicit correction policy (open decision, recorded in STATE.md, not an overwrite) before this is a complete integration."

Notes for the reader:

- A capture, the translator reactions and the events they append stay in one `Translate`
  slice. `then` lists every new fact, so `TranslatingAPass` names both the external fact and ours.
- The unauthenticated-booking spec needs an explicit `given caller` (empty means no caller);
  an authorized command exercised without one is PLAY0389 at binding.
- Authenticity of the webhook, tenant ownership and a score-correction policy are not in the
  model. They are target requirements and an open decision (see the slice description).
