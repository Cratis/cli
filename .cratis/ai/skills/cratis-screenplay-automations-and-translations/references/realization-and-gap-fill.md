# Realization and gap-fill

The `.play` revision is the contract; this file says what that means once code is needed. It is
the automation-and-translation addendum to `cratis-screenplay-render-and-gap-fill`; read that
skill for the admission, publication and ownership rules.

## What Stage does not do
Stage 4.24.0 renders no Automation or Translate slice (Stage#79). A model that contains one is not
admitted: it needs ESM v6, Stage admits ESM v1 to v3 (STAGE-ESM-016 for the whole model), and the
cratis 3.27.1 bundled compiler binds these slices as PLAY0268. So the automation or translation is
hand-written delivery with the model as its contract. A `Customizations/` file never makes a
rejected model renderable, and never claim a whole-application V5 from a subset. Choose the route
with `cratis-screenplay-render-and-gap-fill`.

## Where the pieces go (hand-written)
| Model element | Realization | Skill |
|---|---|---|
| reaction `when <Event>` with `invokes` or `produces` | Chronicle reactor returning commands or events | `cratis-chronicle-reactor` |
| trusted actor for `invokes` | `[ExecuteCommandsAsSystem("<role>")]` on the reactor plus a policy requiring the role (Arc, since v20.56.0; available in a rendered app's Arc 22.25.0) | `cratis-chronicle-reactor` |
| clock trigger, application trigger | scheduler or host signal that raises the occurrence | `cratis-engineering-effect-boundaries` |
| call to an outside system | adapter behind an effect boundary, keyed by the idempotency key in the model | `cratis-engineering-effect-boundaries` |
| capture source (webhook, poll, topic) | adapter that authenticates, parses and appends | `cratis-engineering-effect-boundaries` |
| replay versus recovery redelivery | `[OnceOnly]` for replay; a receipt keyed by `ReactorDelivery.Id` for recovery | `cratis-chronicle-reactor` |

`[ProtectedDecision]` (Arc v22.39.0 and later) is not available in a Stage-rendered app (Arc
22.25.0), and `Directory.Packages.props` there is Stage-managed: do not edit it to get a newer Arc.

## Faithful realization
A realization may choose the reactor, scheduler or queue mechanism. It may not: drop pending
visibility, add filters the model does not state, guess a field, or weaken authorization. Specify
the event-to-command mapping at the reaction boundary (a command-only spec does not exercise it).
An unsupported realization is a gap reported to delivery, never a silent change to the model.
After writing it, check it element by element against the slice with
`cratis-application-slice-conformance`.
