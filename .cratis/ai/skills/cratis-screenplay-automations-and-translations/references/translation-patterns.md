# Translation patterns

Complete compiled example: `translate-example.md` (binds on Screenplay 4.64.0; the cratis 3.27.1
bundled compiler compiles it but rejects the slice at binding).

## 1. Where outside facts may enter
Only two routes, both in a `Translate` slice:
- **`capture`** over a source (api poll, webhook, message topic): key, map, conditional
  appends. Change detection compares each record with the last one seen for the same key.
- **translator `reaction`** over an event imported from another context (unquoted
  `import Context.Event`) or over the external fact a capture appended.
Not a translation: our own event-to-event follow-up (Automation), infrastructure plumbing,
and raw database row changes published as-is.

## 2. Correlation first
Before mapping fields, answer: how does an outside record find *our* stream?
| Situation | Approach |
|---|---|
| we start the outside interaction | allocate our id first and send it out as their reference; their reply echoes it; capture `key` = that field (`translate-example.md`: `reference`) |
| they start it and carry our id | key on it; validate it exists (an unknown id is a case to specify) |
| they only carry their own id | record their id on our fact when we first learn it, and keep a lookup view from their id to ours; the record that arrives before the link exists is a case to specify |
Never make an outside id our stream identity unless the business genuinely identifies the
thing by it. Keep it as a property when it is needed to correlate or deduplicate.

## 3. Two vocabularies
- The capture appends an **external fact** in the provider's terms (`ProctorResultReceived`
  with a translated `outcome`).
- Translator reactions record **our facts** in business terms (`ExamPassed`, `ExamFailed`),
  each guarded by our constraints.
- A further worker needs a distinct local decision, obligation or external effect; otherwise
  project views from our fact directly.
- Name our facts for what they mean to us, not for the transport (`<X>Synced`,
  `<X>WebhookReceived` are smells; a business fact such as `PaymentReceived` is fine).

## 4. Per-field disposition
For every field of the outside record, decide and write in the slice `description`:
| Disposition | Meaning | Screenplay |
|---|---|---|
| **map** | carried into our fact as is or translated | `map` + mapping `x = $.x`; `translate` for codes |
| **enrich** | we add data the record lacks, from our own facts | later decision in a command or view; not in the capture |
| **infer** | derived from the record by a rule the business confirms | `map` template or a translator condition |
| **ignore** | not needed, or not permitted for this purpose | keep it out of appended event payloads; define separately what source/last-seen records the target retains |
Missing data our fact needs: either enrich from our side, or the fact is not ready yet
(model a pending fact plus a case to specify), never invent defaults.
A field left out of `map` still passes through the capture's working record: omission is not
redaction. Check the append mappings and every resulting event property, and record whether
the target stores raw or last-seen source records and how they are minimized.
Personal data kept in events needs `@pii` on its concept and a purpose; keep the annotation
even when it blocks binding. Never record bearer tokens, magic links or signed URLs as facts
(a keyed hash or reference at most), and never put PII on the event-source id.
Malformed or unmappable input becomes a recorded failure fact (or a dead-letter view), never
a dropped record or a thrown error, which would pause the observer partition.

## 5. Dedup and ordering
Two layers, each with its own scope:
1. **Capture change detection** - per `key`, against the last record seen. An unchanged
   redelivery appends nothing. Where the last-seen record is stored and how long it survives
   is the target's business; specs supply it explicitly with `given capture` and never persist
   it.
2. **Constraint on our fact** - `unique event` per stream (one result per attempt), or
   `unique externalRef on OurFact` when the same outside reference must never land on two of
   our streams. A property constraint does **not** stop the same stream receiving the same
   value twice; add `unique event` for that.
Out-of-order records: decide whether an older record may overwrite a newer one. Use
`when field from <v> to <v>` for transitions that only make sense in one direction, and
specify the reverse arrival.
A rejection by our constraint inside a capture stops that record's processing in the
reference; what the target does with the source record (acknowledge, retry, park) is a
realization decision to record.

Distinguish the provider's object id, its event/delivery id and its revision. One object can
produce several legitimate events (charge, refund); define which repetition is a duplicate
and its retention window before choosing constraints. `unique event` fits only when the
business permits that event once per source. Change detection evaluates only the fields in
the append conditions: a redelivery with the same outcome but a changed score or amount is
not automatically a duplicate; decide whether it is a correction, deferred work or a
rejection, and specify it.

## 6. Corrections from outside
When the outside system changes its mind (re-grade, refund, cancelled delivery), the change
is a new fact for us (`ResultCorrected`), never an overwrite. Mutually exclusive
`unique event` lines will refuse a second result; decide with the expert whether a correction
event with `released by` or a separate correction flow is right.

## 7. Specifying translations
- `when capture <Capture>` with record fields (as the source names them) -> `then` the
  external fact and, under v6, what translator reactions appended (`then` lists every new
  fact).
- `given capture` for the previous record when a condition compares (`from … to …`,
  unchanged redelivery).
- `when append <ExternalFact>` -> `then <OurFact>` to test a translator reaction alone.
- Case list: `cases-to-specify.md`. These forms parse (probed in
  `translate-example.md`) but are not executed by any local engine.
