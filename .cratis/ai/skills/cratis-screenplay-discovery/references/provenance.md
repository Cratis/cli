## Adapted closely (MIT, TrogonStack/agentskills)

| Source file (under `plugins/trogonstack-eventmodeling/skills/`) | Used in | How |
|---|---|---|
| `eventmodeling-brainstorming-events/SKILL.md`: Interview Phase (when to interview, critical questions with impact, why it matters and follow-up triggers, conditional entry, two-pass flow) | `SKILL.md` "Interview phase", `references/interview-questions.md` "Interview flow" | structure and four questions adapted; results land in STATE.md instead of a trail file |
| same: Workshop Facilitation Guide (goals, free brainstorm, gentle filtering dialogue, key points, tips for facilitators) | `references/human-workshop.md`, `references/facilitation.md` | adapted to marina examples and Screenplay; the agent scribes |
| same: Role Catalog (mandatory; description, key actions, permissions boundary; system actors with triggers) | `references/personas-and-causes.md`, `SKILL.md` step 2 | adapted to `persona` Does / Reads / Cannot and non-human causes; Cannot resolved to executable gates |
| same: Best practices and Quality Checklist | `SKILL.md` Gate, `references/event-naming.md` | adapted; absolute "all error conditions have events" not adopted |
| `eventmodeling-brainstorming-events/references/facilitating-event-modeling-workshops.md`: participants, invitation, workspace, templates, pacing, personalities, disagreement, remote, post-workshop, multi-day, checklists, success indicators | `references/human-workshop.md` | structure adapted closely; mapped to Screenplay constructs and Cratis phases |
| `eventmodeling-plotting-events/SKILL.md`: sequence, dependencies (can only happen after / triggered by / precondition), alternative paths, output format, quality checklist, principles | `references/plotting-and-handoff.md`, `SKILL.md` step 5 | adapted: after / caused by / only if in the slice `description`; plot format and checks |

Not adopted from the same sources, and why: the "never use an aggregate" rule and per-command state
examples (stream and state design belong to `cratis-screenplay-streams-and-consistency`);
the `.trogonai/interviews/` trail file (replaced by bounded STATE.md); e-commerce examples and
Gherkin forms; the `total (calculated)` field example (contradicts the calculated-value rule);
"capture every error condition as an event" (most failures are rejections).

## Adapted closely (Martin Dilger and Nebulit GmbH, with agreement)

Source: https://github.com/Nebulit-GmbH/agentic-engineer at commit `07b0f30648d663cb588d7e2c7aa031af9dfc21f2`,
by Martin Dilger and Nebulit GmbH (https://nebulit.de). The repository carries no licence file; this material
is adapted with the agreement of Martin Dilger and Nebulit GmbH.

| Source file | Used in | How |
|---|---|---|
| `.claude/skills/timeline/SKILL.md`: fixed opening question, build first then summarize, one question per turn, stop conditions | `SKILL.md` "Interview phase", `references/storming-loop.md`, `references/interview-questions.md` | translated to Screenplay; opening question kept close to the original |
| `.claude/skills/eventmodeling-interview-protocol/SKILL.md`: when to ask, skip what is known, assume visibly when told not to ask | `SKILL.md` "Interview phase" | restored from #493: wording now adapted closely; trail file replaced by STATE.md |
| same: findings recorded per step | `SKILL.md` "Interview phase", `references/interview-questions.md` "Interview flow" | translated: Decisions and Assumptions lists in STATE.md |
| `.claude/skills/eventmodeling-storyboarding-events/SKILL.md`: step 6, processor todo list walked as a storyline | `references/plotting-and-handoff.md` "Storyline" | restored from #493 (item 5, storyline): translated to a view walkthrough seed for lifecycle specifications |
| `.claude/skills/eventmodeling-brainstorming-events/SKILL.md`: divergent journey vs decision point (Nebulit addition) | `SKILL.md` step 5 | idea; our own wording kept (outcome branch vs separate story) |
| same: essential fields only, no padding, payload-free simple transitions (lines 159-160) | `SKILL.md` step 6, `references/storming-loop.md` | now adapted closely; identity, concepts and `@pii` rules kept |
| same: handover from an outside party is a single moment, not a relocation | `SKILL.md` Modeling defaults | idea; our own wording kept |
| `.claude/skills/eventmodeling-storyboarding-events/SKILL.md`: "whose turn is it in the story?" (consistent actor perspective) | `references/plotting-and-handoff.md` "Whose turn is it in the story?" | adapted closely; lanes, columns and screen placement not adopted |

Not adopted: board, chapter, column and `place-element` mechanics; the board API and `connect` skill.

## Original to this corpus

The divergent sweep lenses, the not-an-event filter and its exceptions, the edit kinds, the
compiled discovery skeleton, persona Cannot resolution to gates and denial specs (S6), the
compiler-contract notes and identity-affecting edit routing.
